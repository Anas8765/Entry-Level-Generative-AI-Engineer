Subscribe to our free eBooks blog \\nand email newsletter.\\nCrime and Punishment\\nBy Fyodor Dostoevsky\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\nTranslator’s Preface\\nA \\nfew words about Dostoevsky himself may help the Eng-\\nlish reader to understand his work.\\nDostoevsky was the son of a doctor. His parents were \\nvery hard- working and deeply religious people, but so poor \\nthat they lived with their five children in only two rooms. \\nThe father and mother spent their evenings in reading aloud \\nto their children, generally from books of a serious charac-\\nter.\\nThough always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out \\nthird in the final examination of the Petersburg school of \\nEngineering. There he had already begun his first work, \\n‘Poor Folk.’\\nThis story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his \\nreview and was received with acclamations. The shy, un-\\nknown youth found himself instantly something of a \\ncelebrity. A brilliant and successful career seemed to open \\nbefore him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he \\nwas arrested.\\nThough neither by temperament nor conviction a revolu-\\ntionist, Dostoevsky was one of a little group of young men \\nwho met together to read Fourier and Proudhon. He was ac-\\ncused of ‘taking part in conversations against the censorship, \\nof reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of knowing \\nof the intention to set up a printing press.’ Under Nicholas I. \\n\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n(that ‘stern and just man,’ as Maurice Baring calls him) this \\nwas enough, and he was condemned to death. After eight \\nmonths’ imprisonment he was with twenty-one others tak-\\nen out to the Semyonovsky Square to be shot. Writing to his \\nbrother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: ‘They snapped words over \\nour heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by \\npersons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in \\nthrees to stakes, to suffer execution. Being the third in the \\nrow, I concluded I had only a few minutes of life before me. \\nI thought of you and your dear ones and I contrived to kiss \\nPlestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to bid \\nthem farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were \\nunbound, brought back upon the scaffold, and informed \\nthat his Majesty had spared us our lives.’ The sentence was \\ncommuted to hard labour.\\nOne of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he \\nwas untied, and never regained his sanity.\\nThe intense suffering of this experience left a lasting \\nstamp on Dostoevsky’s mind. Though his religious temper \\nled him in the end to accept every suffering with resignation \\nand to regard it as a blessing in his own case, he constantly \\nrecurs to the subject in his writings. He describes the awful \\nagony of the condemned man and insists on the cruelty of \\ninflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal \\nservitude, spent in the company of common criminals in \\nSiberia, where he began the ‘Dead House,’ and some years \\nof service in a disciplinary battalion.\\nHe had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease be-\\nfore his arrest and this now developed into violent attacks of \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\nepilepsy, from which he suffered for the rest of his life. The \\nfits occurred three or four times a year and were more fre-\\nquent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was allowed to \\nreturn to Russia. He started a journal— ‘Vremya,’ which was \\nforbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. \\nIn 1864 he lost his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was \\nin terrible poverty, yet he took upon himself the payment \\nof his brother’s debts. He started another journal—‘The Ep-\\noch,’ which within a few months was also prohibited. He \\nwas weighed down by debt, his brother’s family was depen-\\ndent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, \\nand is said never to have corrected his work. The later years \\nof his life were much softened by the tenderness and devo-\\ntion of his second wife.\\nIn June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveil-\\ning of the monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was \\nreceived with extraordinary demonstrations of love and \\nhonour.\\nA few months later Dostoevsky died.',\n",
              " 'He was followed to \\nthe grave by a vast multitude of mourners, who ‘gave the \\nhapless man the funeral of a king.’ He is still probably the \\nmost widely read writer in Russia.\\nIn the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the \\nfeeling inspired by Dostoevsky: ‘He was one of ourselves, a \\nman of our blood and our bone, but one who has suffered \\nand has seen so much more deeply than we have his insight \\nimpresses us as wisdom … that wisdom of the heart which \\nwe seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other \\ngifts came to him from nature, this he won for himself and \\n\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthrough it he became great.’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\nPart I\\n\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter I\\nO\\nn an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young \\nman came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. \\nPlace and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards \\nK. bridge.\\nHe had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the \\nstaircase. His garret was under the roof of a high, five-sto-\\nried house and was more like a cupboard than a room. The \\nlandlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and at-\\ntendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went \\nout he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which \\ninvariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young \\nman had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl \\nand feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, \\nand was afraid of meeting her.\\nThis was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite \\nthe contrary; but for some time past he had been in an over-\\nstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. He \\nhad become so completely absorbed in himself, and iso-\\nlated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only \\nhis landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, \\nbut the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh \\nupon him. He had given up attending to matters of practi-\\ncal importance; he had lost all desire to do so. Nothing that \\nany landlady could do had a real terror for him. But to be \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64b\\nstopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial, ir-\\nrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats \\nand complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to pre-\\nvaricate, to lie—no, rather than that, he would creep down \\nthe stairs like a cat and slip out unseen.\\nThis evening, however, on coming out into the street, he \\nbecame acutely aware of his fears.\\n‘I want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened \\nby these trifles,’ he thought, with an odd smile. ‘Hm … yes, \\nall is in a man’s hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, \\nthat’s an axiom. It would be interesting to know what it is \\nmen are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new \\nword is what they fear most…. But I am talking too much. \\nIt’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that \\nI chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter this \\nlast month, lying for days together in my den thinking … \\nof Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I \\ncapable of that? Is that serious? It is not serious at all. It’s \\nsimply a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe \\nit is a plaything.’\\nThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the \\nbustle and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about \\nhim, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all \\nwho are unable to get out of town in summer—all worked \\npainfully upon the young man’s already overwrought \\nnerves. The insufferable stench from the pot- houses, which \\nare particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the \\ndrunken men whom he met continually, although it was a \\nworking day, completed the revolting misery of the picture. \\n\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nAn expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a mo-\\nment in the young man’s refined face. He was, by the way, \\nexceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim, \\nwell-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. \\nSoon he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speak-\\ning into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not \\nobserving what was about him and not caring to observe it. \\nFrom time to time, he would mutter something, from the \\nhabit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. \\nAt these moments he would become conscious that his ideas \\nwere sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for \\ntwo days he had scarcely tasted food.\\nHe was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to \\nshabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street \\nin such rags.',\n",
              " 'In that quarter of the town, however, scarce-\\nly any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise. \\nOwing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number of \\nestablishments of bad character, the preponderance of the \\ntrading and working class population crowded in these \\nstreets and alleys in the heart of Petersburg, types so vari-\\nous were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however \\nqueer, would have caused surprise. But there was such accu-\\nmulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, \\nthat, in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded \\nhis rags least of all in the street. It was a different matter \\nwhen he met with acquaintances or with former fellow stu-\\ndents, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. And \\nyet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, \\nwas being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a \\nCrime and Punishment\\n10\\nheavy dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: \\n‘Hey there, German hatter’ bawling at the top of his voice \\nand pointing at him—the young man stopped suddenly \\nand clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall round hat \\nfrom Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with \\nage, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side \\nin a most unseemly fashion. Not shame, however, but quite \\nanother feeling akin to terror had overtaken him.\\n‘I knew it,’ he muttered in confusion, ‘I thought so! That’s \\nthe worst of all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial \\ndetail might spoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too notice-\\nable…. It looks absurd and that makes it noticeable…. With \\nmy rags I ought to wear a cap, any sort of old pancake, but \\nnot this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such a hat, it would \\nbe noticed a mile off, it would be remembered…. What mat-\\nters is that people would remember it, and that would give \\nthem a clue. For this business one should be as little con-\\nspicuous as possible…. Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, \\nit’s just such trifles that always ruin everything….’\\nHe had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps \\nit was from the gate of his lodging house: exactly seven \\nhundred and thirty. He had counted them once when he \\nhad been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no faith \\nin those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their \\nhideous but daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had \\nbegun to look upon them differently, and, in spite of the \\nmonologues in which he jeered at his own impotence and \\nindecision, he had involuntarily come to regard this ‘hid-\\neous’ dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he still \\n11\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ndid not realise this himself. He was positively going now for \\na ‘rehearsal’ of his project, and at every step his excitement \\ngrew more and more violent.\\nWith a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up \\nto a huge house which on one side looked on to the canal, \\nand on the other into the street. This house was let out in \\ntiny tenements and was inhabited by working people of all \\nkinds—tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of sorts, girls \\npicking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc. There \\nwas a continual coming and going through the two gates \\nand in the two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-\\nkeepers were employed on the building. The young man \\nwas very glad to meet none of them, and at once slipped un-\\nnoticed through the door on the right, and up the staircase. \\nIt was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar \\nwith it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these sur-\\nroundings: in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes \\nwere not to be dreaded.\\n‘If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow \\ncame to pass that I were really going to do it?’ he could not \\nhelp asking himself as he reached the fourth storey. There \\nhis progress was barred by some porters who were engaged \\nin moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the flat had \\nbeen occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and \\nhis family. This German was moving out then, and so the \\nfourth floor on this staircase would be untenanted except by \\nthe old woman. ‘That’s a good thing anyway,’ he thought to \\nhimself, as he rang the bell of the old woman’s flat. The bell \\ngave a faint tinkle as though it were made of tin and not of \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf645\\ncopper. The little flats in such houses always have bells that \\nring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and \\nnow its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something \\nand to bring it clearly before him…. He started, his nerves \\nwere terribly overstrained by now. In a little while, the door \\nwas opened a tiny crack: the old woman eyed her visitor \\nwith evident distrust through the crack, and nothing could \\nbe seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness. But, \\nseeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, \\nand opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the \\ndark entry, which was partitioned off from the tiny kitch-\\nen. The old woman stood facing him in silence and looking \\ninquiringly at him.',\n",
              " 'She was a diminutive, withered up old \\nwoman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp lit-\\ntle nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly \\nsmeared with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round \\nher thin long neck, which looked like a hen’s leg, was knot-\\nted some sort of flannel rag, and, in spite of the heat, there \\nhung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy fur cape, yellow \\nwith age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every in-\\nstant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather \\npeculiar expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her \\neyes again.\\n‘Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,’ the \\nyoung man made haste to mutter, with a half bow, remem-\\nbering that he ought to be more polite.\\n‘I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your \\ncoming here,’ the old woman said distinctly, still keeping \\nher inquiring eyes on his face.\\n1\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘And here … I am again on the same errand,’ Raskol-\\nnikov continued, a little disconcerted and surprised at \\nthe old woman’s mistrust. ‘Perhaps she is always like that \\nthough, only I did not notice it the other time,’ he thought \\nwith an uneasy feeling.\\nThe old woman paused, as though hesitating; then \\nstepped on one side, and pointing to the door of the room, \\nshe said, letting her visitor pass in front of her:\\n‘Step in, my good sir.’\\nThe little room into which the young man walked, with \\nyellow paper on the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains \\nin the windows, was brightly lighted up at that moment by \\nthe setting sun.\\n‘So the sun will shine like this then too!’ flashed as it were \\nby chance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid \\nglance he scanned everything in the room, trying as far as \\npossible to notice and remember its arrangement. But there \\nwas nothing special in the room. The furniture, all very old \\nand of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge bent \\nwooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-\\ntable with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows, \\nchairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in \\nyellow frames, representing German damsels with birds in \\ntheir hands—that was all. In the corner a light was burning \\nbefore a small ikon. Everything was very clean; the floor and \\nthe furniture were brightly polished; everything shone.\\n‘Lizaveta’s work,’ thought the young man. There was not \\na speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat.\\n‘It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf647\\nsuch cleanliness,’ Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole \\na curious glance at the cotton curtain over the door leading \\ninto another tiny room, in which stood the old woman’s bed \\nand chest of drawers and into which he had never looked \\nbefore. These two rooms made up the whole flat.\\n‘What do you want?’ the old woman said severely, com-\\ning into the room and, as before, standing in front of him so \\nas to look him straight in the face.\\n‘I’ve brought something to pawn here,’ and he drew out \\nof his pocket an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back \\nof which was engraved a globe; the chain was of steel.\\n‘But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up \\nthe day before yesterday.’\\n‘I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a \\nlittle.’\\n‘But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or \\nto sell your pledge at once.’\\n‘How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Iva-\\nnovna?’\\n‘You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely \\nworth anything. I gave you two roubles last time for your \\nring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler’s for a rou-\\nble and a half.’\\n‘Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my \\nfather’s. I shall be getting some money soon.’\\n‘A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!’\\n‘A rouble and a half!’ cried the young man.\\n‘Please yourself’—and the old woman handed him back \\nthe watch. The young man took it, and was so angry that he \\n1\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nwas on the point of going away; but checked himself at once, \\nremembering that there was nowhere else he could go, and \\nthat he had had another object also in coming.\\n‘Hand it over,’ he said roughly.\\nThe old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and \\ndisappeared behind the curtain into the other room. The \\nyoung man, left standing alone in the middle of the room, \\nlistened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear her unlock-\\ning the chest of drawers.\\n‘It must be the top drawer,’ he reflected.',\n",
              " '‘So she carries \\nthe keys in a pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel \\nring…. And there’s one key there, three times as big as all \\nthe others, with deep notches; that can’t be the key of the \\nchest of drawers … then there must be some other chest or \\nstrong-box … that’s worth knowing. Strong-boxes always \\nhave keys like that … but how degrading it all is.’\\nThe old woman came back.\\n‘Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so \\nI must take fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the \\nmonth in advance. But for the two roubles I lent you before, \\nyou owe me now twenty copecks on the same reckoning \\nin advance. That makes thirty-five copecks altogether. So \\nI must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch. \\nHere it is.’\\n‘What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!’\\n‘Just so.’\\nThe young man did not dispute it and took the money. \\nHe looked at the old woman, and was in no hurry to get \\naway, as though there was still something he wanted to say \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf649\\nor to do, but he did not himself quite know what.\\n‘I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, \\nAlyona Ivanovna —a valuable thing—silver—a cigarette-\\nbox, as soon as I get it back from a friend …’ he broke off in \\nconfusion.\\n‘Well, we will talk about it then, sir.’\\n‘Good-bye—are you always at home alone, your sister is \\nnot here with you?’ He asked her as casually as possible as \\nhe went out into the passage.\\n‘What business is she of yours, my good sir?’\\n‘Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too \\nquick…. Good-day, Alyona Ivanovna.’\\nRaskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This con-\\nfusion became more and more intense. As he went down the \\nstairs, he even stopped short, two or three times, as though \\nsuddenly struck by some thought. When he was in the street \\nhe cried out, ‘Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and can I, \\ncan I possibly…. No, it’s nonsense, it’s rubbish!’ he added \\nresolutely. ‘And how could such an atrocious thing come \\ninto my head? What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, \\nfilthy above all, disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!—and for \\na whole month I’ve been….’ But no words, no exclamations, \\ncould express his agitation. The feeling of intense repulsion, \\nwhich had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he \\nwas on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such \\na pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not \\nknow what to do with himself to escape from his wretched-\\nness. He walked along the pavement like a drunken man, \\nregardless of the passers-by, and jostling against them, and \\n1\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nonly came to his senses when he was in the next street. Look-\\ning round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern \\nwhich was entered by steps leading from the pavement to \\nthe basement. At that instant two drunken men came out \\nat the door, and abusing and supporting one another, they \\nmounted the steps. Without stopping to think, Raskolnikov \\nwent down the steps at once. Till that moment he had never \\nbeen into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented \\nby a burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and \\nattributed his sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat \\ndown at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner; or-\\ndered some beer, and eagerly drank off the first glassful. At \\nonce he felt easier; and his thoughts became clear.\\n‘All that’s nonsense,’ he said hopefully, ‘and there is noth-\\ning in it all to worry about! It’s simply physical derangement. \\nJust a glass of beer, a piece of dry bread—and in one mo-\\nment the brain is stronger, the mind is clearer and the will \\nis firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all is!’\\nBut in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now \\nlooking cheerful as though he were suddenly set free from \\na terrible burden: and he gazed round in a friendly way at \\nthe people in the room. But even at that moment he had a \\ndim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also \\nnot normal.',\n",
              " 'There were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides \\nthe two drunken men he had met on the steps, a group con-\\nsisting of about five men and a girl with a concertina had \\ngone out at the same time. Their departure left the room \\nquiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern were \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf64b\\na man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not ex-\\ntremely so, sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, \\na huge, stout man with a grey beard, in a short full-skirted \\ncoat. He was very drunk: and had dropped asleep on the \\nbench; every now and then, he began as though in his sleep, \\ncracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the up-\\nper part of his body bounding about on the bench, while he \\nhummed some meaningless refrain, trying to recall some \\nsuch lines as these:\\n‘His wife a year he fondly loved His wife a—a year he—\\nfondly loved.’\\nOr suddenly waking up again:\\n‘Walking along the crowded row He met the one he used \\nto know.’\\nBut no one shared his enjoyment: his silent compan-\\nion looked with positive hostility and mistrust at all these \\nmanifestations. There was another man in the room who \\nlooked somewhat like a retired government clerk. He was \\nsitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and look-\\ning round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some \\nagitation.\\n1\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter II\\nR\\naskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said be-\\nfore, he avoided society of every sort, more especially \\nof late. But now all at once he felt a desire to be with other \\npeople. Something new seemed to be taking place within \\nhim, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He was \\nso weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness \\nand gloomy excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a \\nmoment, in some other world, whatever it might be; and, in \\nspite of the filthiness of the surroundings, he was glad now \\nto stay in the tavern.\\nThe master of the establishment was in another room, but \\nhe frequently came down some steps into the main room, \\nhis jaunty, tarred boots with red turn-over tops coming \\ninto view each time before the rest of his person. He wore \\na full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat, with \\nno cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like \\nan iron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, \\nand there was another boy somewhat younger who handed \\nwhatever was wanted. On the counter lay some sliced cu-\\ncumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and some fish, \\nchopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably \\nclose, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five min-\\nutes in such an atmosphere might well make a man drunk.\\nThere are chance meetings with strangers that interest \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6450\\nus from the first moment, before a word is spoken. Such \\nwas the impression made on Raskolnikov by the person sit-\\nting a little distance from him, who looked like a retired \\nclerk. The young man often recalled this impression af-\\nterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked \\nrepeatedly at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter \\nwas staring persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter \\ninto conversation. At the other persons in the room, includ-\\ning the tavern- keeper, the clerk looked as though he were \\nused to their company, and weary of it, showing a shade of \\ncondescending contempt for them as persons of station and \\nculture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless \\nfor him to converse. He was a man over fifty, bald and griz-\\nzled, of medium height, and stoutly built. His face, bloated \\nfrom continual drinking, was of a yellow, even greenish, \\ntinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen reddish eyes \\ngleamed like little chinks. But there was something very \\nstrange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of \\nintense feeling—perhaps there were even thought and intel-\\nligence, but at the same time there was a gleam of something \\nlike madness. He was wearing an old and hopelessly ragged \\nblack dress coat, with all its buttons missing except one, \\nand that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this \\nlast trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered \\nwith spots and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. \\nLike a clerk, he wore no beard, nor moustache, but had been \\nso long unshaven that his chin looked like a stiff greyish \\nbrush. And there was something respectable and like an of-\\nficial about his manner too. But he was restless; he ruffled \\n\\uf6451\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nup his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his \\nhands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained \\nand sticky table. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, \\nand said loudly and resolutely:\\n‘May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite con-\\nversation? Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not \\ncommand respect, my experience admonishes me that you \\nare a man of education and not accustomed to drinking. I \\nhave always respected education when in conjunction with \\ngenuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular counsellor in \\nrank. Marmeladov—such is my name; titular counsellor. I \\nmake bold to inquire—have you been in the service?’\\n‘No, I am studying,’ answered the young man, some-\\nwhat surprised at the grandiloquent style of the speaker \\nand also at being so directly addressed. In spite of the mo-\\nmentary desire he had just been feeling for company of any \\nsort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his \\nhabitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who \\napproached or attempted to approach him.\\n‘A student then, or formerly a student,’ cried the clerk.',\n",
              " '‘Just what I thought! I’m a man of experience, immense ex-\\nperience, sir,’ and he tapped his forehead with his fingers \\nin self-approval. ‘You’ve been a student or have attended \\nsome learned institution! … But allow me….’ He got up, \\nstaggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside \\nthe young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, \\nbut spoke fluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the \\nthread of his sentences and drawling his words. He pounced \\nupon Raskolnikov as greedily as though he too had not spo-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf645\\nken to a soul for a month.\\n‘Honoured sir,’ he began almost with solemnity, ‘poverty \\nis not a vice, that’s a true saying. Yet I know too that drunk-\\nenness is not a virtue, and that that’s even truer. But beggary, \\nhonoured sir, beggary is a vice. In poverty you may still re-\\ntain your innate nobility of soul, but in beggary—never—no \\none. For beggary a man is not chased out of human society \\nwith a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it \\nas humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch \\nas in beggary I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. \\nHence the pot-house! Honoured sir, a month ago Mr. Le-\\nbeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and my wife is a very \\ndifferent matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me to \\nask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you \\never spent a night on a hay barge, on the Neva?’\\n‘No, I have not happened to,’ answered Raskolnikov. \\n‘What do you mean?’\\n‘Well, I’ve just come from one and it’s the fifth night I’ve \\nslept so….’ He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of \\nhay were in fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his \\nhair. It seemed quite probable that he had not undressed or \\nwashed for the last five days. His hands, particularly, were \\nfilthy. They were fat and red, with black nails.\\nHis conversation seemed to excite a general though lan-\\nguid interest. The boys at the counter fell to sniggering. The \\ninnkeeper came down from the upper room, apparently on \\npurpose to listen to the ‘funny fellow’ and sat down at a \\nlittle distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity. Evidently \\nMarmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most \\n\\uf645\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nlikely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from \\nthe habit of frequently entering into conversation with \\nstrangers of all sorts in the tavern. This habit develops into \\na necessity in some drunkards, and especially in those who \\nare looked after sharply and kept in order at home. Hence \\nin the company of other drinkers they try to justify them-\\nselves and even if possible obtain consideration.\\n‘Funny fellow!’ pronounced the innkeeper. ‘And why \\ndon’t you work, why aren’t you at your duty, if you are in \\nthe service?’\\n‘Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir,’ Marmeladov \\nwent on, addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as \\nthough it had been he who put that question to him. ‘Why \\nam I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache to think what \\na useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov \\nbeat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn’t I \\nsuffer? Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you \\n… hm … well, to petition hopelessly for a loan?’\\n‘Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?’\\n‘Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know before-\\nhand that you will get nothing by it. You know, for instance, \\nbeforehand with positive certainty that this man, this most \\nreputable and exemplary citizen, will on no consideration \\ngive you money; and indeed I ask you why should he? For \\nhe knows of course that I shan’t pay it back. From compas-\\nsion? But Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern \\nideas explained the other day that compassion is forbidden \\nnowadays by science itself, and that that’s what is done now \\nin England, where there is political economy. Why, I ask \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf647\\nyou, should he give it to me? And yet though I know before-\\nhand that he won’t, I set off to him and …’\\n‘Why do you go?’ put in Raskolnikov.\\n‘Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! \\nFor every man must have somewhere to go. Since there are \\ntimes when one absolutely must go somewhere! When my \\nown daughter first went out with a yellow ticket, then I had \\nto go … (for my daughter has a yellow passport),’ he add-\\ned in parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the \\nyoung man. ‘No matter, sir, no matter!’ he went on hurried-\\nly and with apparent composure when both the boys at the \\ncounter guffawed and even the innkeeper smiled—‘No mat-\\nter, I am not confounded by the wagging of their heads; for \\neveryone knows everything about it already, and all that is \\nsecret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, \\nbut with humility. So be it! So be it! ‘Behold the man!’ Ex-\\ncuse me, young man, can you…. No, to put it more strongly \\nand more distinctly; not can you but dare you, looking upon \\nme, assert that I am not a pig?’\\nThe young man did not answer a word.',\n",
              " '‘Well,’ the orator began again stolidly and with even in-\\ncreased dignity, after waiting for the laughter in the room \\nto subside. ‘Well, so be it, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I \\nhave the semblance of a beast, but Katerina Ivanovna, my \\nspouse, is a person of education and an officer’s daughter. \\nGranted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of \\na noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And \\nyet … oh, if only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, \\nyou know every man ought to have at least one place where \\n\\uf645\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\npeople feel for him! But Katerina Ivanovna, though she is \\nmagnanimous, she is unjust…. And yet, although I realise \\nthat when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity—for \\nI repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young \\nman,’ he declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the snig-\\ngering again—‘but, my God, if she would but once…. But \\nno, no! It’s all in vain and it’s no use talking! No use talk-\\ning! For more than once, my wish did come true and more \\nthan once she has felt for me but … such is my fate and I am \\na beast by nature!’\\n‘Rather!’ assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov \\nstruck his fist resolutely on the table.\\n‘Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have \\nsold her very stockings for drink? Not her shoes—that \\nwould be more or less in the order of things, but her stock-\\nings, her stockings I have sold for drink! Her mohair shawl \\nI sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own property, \\nnot mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold \\nthis winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. \\nWe have three little children and Katerina Ivanovna is at \\nwork from morning till night; she is scrubbing and cleaning \\nand washing the children, for she’s been used to cleanliness \\nfrom a child. But her chest is weak and she has a tendency \\nto consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I don’t feel it? \\nAnd the more I drink the more I feel it. That’s why I drink \\ntoo. I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink…. I drink so \\nthat I may suffer twice as much!’ And as though in despair \\nhe laid his head down on the table.\\n‘Young man,’ he went on, raising his head again, ‘in your \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf649\\nface I seem to read some trouble of mind. When you came \\nin I read it, and that was why I addressed you at once. For \\nin unfolding to you the story of my life, I do not wish to \\nmake myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners, \\nwho indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a \\nman of feeling and education. Know then that my wife was \\neducated in a high-class school for the daughters of noble-\\nmen, and on leaving she danced the shawl dance before the \\ngovernor and other personages for which she was presented \\nwith a gold medal and a certificate of merit. The medal … \\nwell, the medal of course was sold—long ago, hm … but the \\ncertificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she \\nshowed it to our landlady. And although she is most con-\\ntinually on bad terms with the landlady, yet she wanted to \\ntell someone or other of her past honours and of the happy \\ndays that are gone. I don’t condemn her for it, I don’t blame \\nher, for the one thing left her is recollection of the past, and \\nall the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady of spirit, \\nproud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has \\nnothing but black bread to eat, but won’t allow herself to be \\ntreated with disrespect. That’s why she would not overlook \\nMr. Lebeziatnikov’s rudeness to her, and so when he gave \\nher a beating for it, she took to her bed more from the hurt \\nto her feelings than from the blows. She was a widow when I \\nmarried her, with three children, one smaller than the other. \\nShe married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, \\nand ran away with him from her father’s house. She was \\nexceedingly fond of her husband; but he gave way to cards, \\ngot into trouble and with that he died. He used to beat her \\n\\uf645\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nat the end: and although she paid him back, of which I have \\nauthentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of \\nhim with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, \\nI am glad that, though only in imagination, she should think \\nof herself as having once been happy…. And she was left at \\nhis death with three children in a wild and remote district \\nwhere I happened to be at the time; and she was left in such \\nhopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups and \\ndowns of all sort, I don’t feel equal to describing it even. Her \\nrelations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, \\nexcessively proud…. And then, honoured sir, and then, I, \\nbeing at the time a widower, with a daughter of fourteen \\nleft me by my first wife, offered her my hand, for I could not \\nbear the sight of such suffering. You can judge the extremity \\nof her calamities, that she, a woman of education and cul-\\nture and distinguished family, should have consented to be \\nmy wife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing \\nher hands, she married me! For she had nowhere to turn! \\nDo you understand, sir, do you understand what it means \\nwhen you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No, that you \\ndon’t understand yet…. And for a whole year, I performed \\nmy duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch \\nthis’ (he tapped the jug with his finger), ‘for I have feelings. \\nBut even so, I could not please her; and then I lost my place \\ntoo, and that through no fault of mine but through changes \\nin the office; and then I did touch it! … It will be a year and \\na half ago soon since we found ourselves at last after many \\nwanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent \\ncapital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I ob-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf64b\\ntained a situation…. I obtained it and I lost it again.',\n",
              " 'Do you \\nunderstand? This time it was through my own fault I lost \\nit: for my weakness had come out…. We have now part of \\na room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel’s; and what we \\nlive upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say. \\nThere are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt \\nand disorder, a perfect Bedlam … hm … yes … And mean-\\nwhile my daughter by my first wife has grown up; and what \\nmy daughter has had to put up with from her step-mother \\nwhilst she was growing up, I won’t speak of. For, though \\nKaterina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spir-\\nited lady, irritable and short—tempered…. Yes. But it’s no \\nuse going over that! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had \\nno education. I did make an effort four years ago to give her \\na course of geography and universal history, but as I was \\nnot very well up in those subjects myself and we had no \\nsuitable books, and what books we had … hm, anyway we \\nhave not even those now, so all our instruction came to an \\nend. We stopped at Cyrus of Persia. Since she has attained \\nyears of maturity, she has read other books of romantic ten-\\ndency and of late she had read with great interest a book \\nshe got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes’ Physiology—do \\nyou know it?—and even recounted extracts from it to us: \\nand that’s the whole of her education. And now may I ven-\\nture to address you, honoured sir, on my own account with \\na private question. Do you suppose that a respectable poor \\ngirl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen farthings a \\nday can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special tal-\\nent and that without putting her work down for an instant! \\n\\uf645\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nAnd what’s more, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsel-\\nlor—have you heard of him?—has not to this day paid her \\nfor the half-dozen linen shirts she made him and drove her \\nroughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the pretext that \\nthe shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were \\nput in askew. And there are the little ones hungry…. And \\nKaterina Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her \\nhands, her cheeks flushed red, as they always are in that dis-\\nease: ‘Here you live with us,’ says she, ‘you eat and drink and \\nare kept warm and you do nothing to help.’ And much she \\ngets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the little \\nones for three days! I was lying at the time … well, what of \\nit! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she \\nis a gentle creature with a soft little voice … fair hair and \\nsuch a pale, thin little face). She said: ‘Katerina Ivanovna, \\nam I really to do a thing like that?’ And Darya Frantsov-\\nna, a woman of evil character and very well known to the \\npolice, had two or three times tried to get at her through \\nthe landlady. ‘And why not?’ said Katerina Ivanovna with \\na jeer, ‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful \\nof!’ But don’t blame her, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t \\nblame her! She was not herself when she spoke, but driven \\nto distraction by her illness and the crying of the hungry \\nchildren; and it was said more to wound her than anything \\nelse…. For that’s Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when \\nchildren cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them \\nat once. At six o’clock I saw Sonia get up, put on her ker-\\nchief and her cape, and go out of the room and about nine \\no’clock she came back. She walked straight up to Katerina \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6460\\nIvanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her \\nin silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at \\nher, she simply picked up our big green drap de dames shawl \\n(we have a shawl, made of drap de dames), put it over her \\nhead and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the \\nwall; only her little shoulders and her body kept shudder-\\ning…. And I went on lying there, just as before…. And then \\nI saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same si-\\nlence go up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the \\nevening kissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then \\nthey both fell asleep in each other’s arms … together, to-\\ngether … yes … and I … lay drunk.’\\nMarmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had \\nfailed him. Then he hurriedly filled his glass, drank, and \\ncleared his throat.\\n‘Since then, sir,’ he went on after a brief pause—‘Since \\nthen, owing to an unfortunate occurrence and through in-\\nformation given by evil- intentioned persons—in all which \\nDarya Frantsovna took a leading part on the pretext that \\nshe had been treated with want of respect—since then my \\ndaughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take a yel-\\nlow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living \\nwith us. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not \\nhear of it (though she had backed up Darya Frantsovna be-\\nfore) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too … hm…. All the trouble \\nbetween him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia’s ac-\\ncount. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and \\nthen all of a sudden he stood on his dignity: ‘how,’ said he, \\n‘can a highly educated man like me live in the same rooms \\n\\uf6461\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nwith a girl like that?’ And Katerina Ivanovna would not let \\nit pass, she stood up for her … and so that’s how it hap-\\npened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she \\ncomforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can…. \\nShe has a room at the Kapernaumovs’ the tailors, she lodges \\nwith them; Kapernaumov is a lame man with a cleft palate \\nand all of his numerous family have cleft palates too. And \\nhis wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in one room, \\nbut Sonia has her own, partitioned off…. Hm … yes … very \\npoor people and all with cleft palates … yes. Then I got up \\nin the morning, and put on my rags, lifted up my hands to \\nheaven and set off to his excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His \\nexcellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you know him? No? Well, \\nthen, it’s a man of God you don’t know.',\n",
              " 'He is wax … wax \\nbefore the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth! … His eyes \\nwere dim when he heard my story. ‘Marmeladov, once al-\\nready you have deceived my expectations … I’ll take you \\nonce more on my own responsibility’—that’s what he said, \\n‘remember,’ he said, ‘and now you can go.’ I kissed the dust \\nat his feet—in thought only, for in reality he would not have \\nallowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of modern \\npolitical and enlightened ideas. I returned home, and when \\nI announced that I’d been taken back into the service and \\nshould receive a salary, heavens, what a to-do there was …!’\\nMarmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At \\nthat moment a whole party of revellers already drunk came \\nin from the street, and the sounds of a hired concertina and \\nthe cracked piping voice of a child of seven singing ‘The \\nHamlet’ were heard in the entry. The room was filled with \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf645\\nnoise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the \\nnew-comers. Marmeladov paying no attention to the new \\narrivals continued his story. He appeared by now to be ex-\\ntremely weak, but as he became more and more drunk, he \\nbecame more and more talkative. The recollection of his re-\\ncent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, \\nand was positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. \\nRaskolnikov listened attentively.\\n‘That was five weeks ago, sir. Yes…. As soon as Kateri-\\nna Ivanovna and Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as \\nthough I stepped into the kingdom of Heaven. It used to \\nbe: you can lie like a beast, nothing but abuse. Now they \\nwere walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. ‘Semyon Za-\\nharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, \\nshh!’ They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled \\ncream for me! They began to get real cream for me, do you \\nhear that? And how they managed to get together the mon-\\ney for a decent outfit— eleven roubles, fifty copecks, I can’t \\nguess. Boots, cotton shirt- fronts—most magnificent, a uni-\\nform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and \\na half. The first morning I came back from the office I found \\nKaterina Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner—\\nsoup and salt meat with horse radish—which we had never \\ndreamed of till then. She had not any dresses … none at all, \\nbut she got herself up as though she were going on a visit; \\nand not that she’d anything to do it with, she smartened her-\\nself up with nothing at all, she’d done her hair nicely, put on \\na clean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a \\ndifferent person, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, \\n\\uf646\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nmy little darling, had only helped with money ‘for the time,’ \\nshe said, ‘it won’t do for me to come and see you too often. \\nAfter dark maybe when no one can see.’ Do you hear, do \\nyou hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you \\nthink: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last \\ndegree with our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week \\nbefore, she could not resist then asking her in to coffee. For \\ntwo hours they were sitting, whispering together. ‘Semyon \\nZaharovitch is in the service again, now, and receiving a \\nsalary,’ says she, ‘and he went himself to his excellency and \\nhis excellency himself came out to him, made all the others \\nwait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before every-\\nbody into his study.’ Do you hear, do you hear? ‘To be sure,’ \\nsays he, ‘Semyon Zaharovitch, remembering your past ser-\\nvices,’ says he, ‘and in spite of your propensity to that foolish \\nweakness, since you promise now and since moreover we’ve \\ngot on badly without you,’ (do you hear, do you hear;) ‘and \\nso,’ says he, ‘I rely now on your word as a gentleman.’ And \\nall that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, \\nand not simply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; \\nno, she believes it all herself, she amuses herself with her \\nown fancies, upon my word she does! And I don’t blame her \\nfor it, no, I don’t blame her! … Six days ago when I brought \\nher my first earnings in full—twenty-three roubles forty co-\\npecks altogether—she called me her poppet: ‘poppet,’ said \\nshe, ‘my little poppet.’ And when we were by ourselves, you \\nunderstand? You would not think me a beauty, you would \\nnot think much of me as a husband, would you? … Well, \\nshe pinched my cheek, ‘my little poppet,’ said she.’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf647\\nMarmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his \\nchin began to twitch. He controlled himself however. The \\ntavern, the degraded appearance of the man, the five nights \\nin the hay barge, and the pot of spirits, and yet this poignant \\nlove for his wife and children bewildered his listener. Ras-\\nkolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation. He felt \\nvexed that he had come here.\\n‘Honoured sir, honoured sir,’ cried Marmeladov recov-\\nering himself— ‘Oh, sir, perhaps all this seems a laughing \\nmatter to you, as it does to others, and perhaps I am only \\nworrying you with the stupidity of all the trivial details of \\nmy home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me. For I can \\nfeel it all…. And the whole of that heavenly day of my life \\nand the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams \\nof how I would arrange it all, and how I would dress all the \\nchildren, and how I should give her rest, and how I should \\nrescue my own daughter from dishonour and restore her to \\nthe bosom of her family…. And a great deal more…. Quite \\nexcusable, sir. Well, then, sir’ (Marmeladov suddenly gave \\na sort of start, raised his head and gazed intently at his lis-\\ntener) ‘well, on the very next day after all those dreams, that \\nis to say, exactly five days ago, in the evening, by a cunning \\ntrick, like a thief in the night, I stole from Katerina Ivanov-\\nna the key of her box, took out what was left of my earnings, \\nhow much it was I have forgotten, and now look at me, all \\nof you! It’s the fifth day since I left home, and they are look-\\ning for me there and it’s the end of my employment, and \\nmy uniform is lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge.',\n",
              " 'I \\nexchanged it for the garments I have on … and it’s the end \\n\\uf646\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nof everything!’\\nMarmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched \\nhis teeth, closed his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow \\non the table. But a minute later his face suddenly changed \\nand with a certain assumed slyness and affectation of bra-\\nvado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:\\n‘This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a \\npick-me-up! He-he-he!’\\n‘You don’t say she gave it to you?’ cried one of the new-\\ncomers; he shouted the words and went off into a guffaw.\\n‘This very quart was bought with her money,’ Marmeladov \\ndeclared, addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. \\n‘Thirty copecks she gave me with her own hands, her last, \\nall she had, as I saw…. She said nothing, she only looked at \\nme without a word…. Not on earth, but up yonder … they \\ngrieve over men, they weep, but they don’t blame them, \\nthey don’t blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more \\nwhen they don’t blame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe \\nshe needs them now, eh? What do you think, my dear sir? \\nFor now she’s got to keep up her appearance. It costs mon-\\ney, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do \\nyou understand? And there’s pomatum, too, you see, she \\nmust have things; petticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real \\njaunty ones to show off her foot when she has to step over \\na puddle. Do you understand, sir, do you understand what \\nall that smartness means? And here I, her own father, here \\nI took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am \\ndrinking it! And I have already drunk it! Come, who will \\nhave pity on a man like me, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf649\\nnot? Tell me, sir, are you sorry or not? He-he-he!’\\nHe would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. \\nThe pot was empty.\\n‘What are you to be pitied for?’ shouted the tavern-keeper \\nwho was again near them.\\nShouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter \\nand the oaths came from those who were listening and also \\nfrom those who had heard nothing but were simply looking \\nat the figure of the discharged government clerk.\\n‘To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied?’ Marmeladov sud-\\ndenly declaimed, standing up with his arm outstretched, as \\nthough he had been only waiting for that question.\\n‘Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there’s nothing to \\npity me for! I ought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not \\npitied! Crucify me, oh judge, crucify me but pity me! And \\nthen I will go of myself to be crucified, for it’s not merry-\\nmaking I seek but tears and tribulation! … Do you suppose, \\nyou that sell, that this pint of yours has been sweet to me? It \\nwas tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and tribu-\\nlation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will \\npity us Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood \\nall men and all things, He is the One, He too is the judge. \\nHe will come in that day and He will ask: ‘Where is the \\ndaughter who gave herself for her cross, consumptive step-\\nmother and for the little children of another? Where is the \\ndaughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earth-\\nly father, undismayed by his beastliness?’ And He will say, \\n‘Come to me! I have already forgiven thee once…. I have \\nforgiven thee once…. Thy sins which are many are forgiv-\\n\\uf646\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nen thee for thou hast loved much….’ And he will forgive \\nmy Sonia, He will forgive, I know it … I felt it in my heart \\nwhen I was with her just now! And He will judge and will \\nforgive all, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek…. \\nAnd when He has done with all of them, then He will sum-\\nmon us. ‘You too come forth,’ He will say, ‘Come forth ye \\ndrunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come forth, ye chil-\\ndren of shame!’ And we shall all come forth, without shame \\nand shall stand before him. And He will say unto us, ‘Ye are \\nswine, made in the Image of the Beast and with his mark; \\nbut come ye also!’ And the wise ones and those of under-\\nstanding will say, ‘Oh Lord, why dost Thou receive these \\nmen?’ And He will say, ‘This is why I receive them, oh ye \\nwise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, \\nthat not one of them believed himself to be worthy of this.’ \\nAnd He will hold out His hands to us and we shall fall down \\nbefore him … and we shall weep … and we shall under-\\nstand all things!

Lord, Thy kingdom come!’ And he sank down on \\nthe bench exhausted, and helpless, looking at no one, ap-\\nparently oblivious of his surroundings and plunged in deep \\nthought. His words had created a certain impression; there \\nwas a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were \\nheard again.\\n‘That’s his notion!’\\n‘Talked himself silly!’\\n‘A fine clerk he is!’\\nAnd so on, and so on.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf64b\\n‘Let us go, sir,’ said Marmeladov all at once, raising his \\nhead and addressing Raskolnikov—‘come along with me … \\nKozel’s house, looking into the yard. I’m going to Katerina \\nIvanovna—time I did.’\\nRaskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and \\nhe had meant to help him. Marmeladov was much unsteadi-\\ner on his legs than in his speech and leaned heavily on the \\nyoung man. They had two or three hundred paces to go. The \\ndrunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and \\nconfusion as they drew nearer the house.\\n‘It’s not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now,’ he mut-\\ntered in agitation—‘and that she will begin pulling my hair. \\nWhat does my hair matter! Bother my hair! That’s what \\nI say! Indeed it will be better if she does begin pulling it, \\nthat’s not what I am afraid of … it’s her eyes I am afraid of \\n… yes, her eyes … the red on her cheeks, too, frightens me \\n… and her breathing too…. Have you noticed how people in \\nthat disease breathe … when they are excited? I am fright-\\nened of the children’s crying, too…. For if Sonia has not \\ntaken them food … I don’t know what’s happened! I don’t \\nknow! But blows I am not afraid of…. Know, sir, that such \\nblows are not a pain to me, but even an enjoyment. In fact I \\ncan’t get on without it…. It’s better so.',\n",
              " 'Let her strike me, it \\nrelieves her heart … it’s better so … There is the house. The \\nhouse of Kozel, the cabinet-maker … a German, well-to-do. \\nLead the way!’\\nThey went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. \\nThe staircase got darker and darker as they went up. It was \\nnearly eleven o’clock and although in summer in Peters-\\n\\uf646\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nburg there is no real night, yet it was quite dark at the top \\nof the stairs.\\nA grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. \\nA very poor-looking room about ten paces long was light-\\ned up by a candle-end; the whole of it was visible from the \\nentrance. It was all in disorder, littered up with rags of all \\nsorts, especially children’s garments. Across the furthest \\ncorner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it probably was \\nthe bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs \\nand a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, be-\\nfore which stood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and \\nuncovered. At the edge of the table stood a smoldering \\ntallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It appeared that the \\nfamily had a room to themselves, not part of a room, but \\ntheir room was practically a passage. The door leading to \\nthe other rooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia \\nLippevechsel’s flat was divided stood half open, and there \\nwas shouting, uproar and laughter within. People seemed to \\nbe playing cards and drinking tea there. Words of the most \\nunceremonious kind flew out from time to time.\\nRaskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She \\nwas a rather tall, slim and graceful woman, terribly emaci-\\nated, with magnificent dark brown hair and with a hectic \\nflush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and down in her little \\nroom, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips were \\nparched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. \\nHer eyes glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh \\nimmovable stare. And that consumptive and excited face \\nwith the last flickering light of the candle-end playing upon \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6470\\nit made a sickening impression. She seemed to Raskolnikov \\nabout thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for \\nMarmeladov…. She had not heard them and did not notice \\nthem coming in. She seemed to be lost in thought, hear-\\ning and seeing nothing. The room was close, but she had \\nnot opened the window; a stench rose from the staircase, \\nbut the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner \\nrooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept cough-\\ning, but did not close the door. The youngest child, a girl of \\nsix, was asleep, sitting curled up on the floor with her head \\non the sofa. A boy a year older stood crying and shaking in \\nthe corner, probably he had just had a beating. Beside him \\nstood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin, wearing a thin \\nand ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung \\nover her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reach-\\ning her knees. Her arm, as thin as a stick, was round her \\nbrother’s neck. She was trying to comfort him, whispering \\nsomething to him, and doing all she could to keep him from \\nwhimpering again. At the same time her large dark eyes, \\nwhich looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened \\nface, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov \\ndid not enter the door, but dropped on his knees in the very \\ndoorway, pushing Raskolnikov in front of him. The woman \\nseeing a stranger stopped indifferently facing him, coming \\nto herself for a moment and apparently wondering what he \\nhad come for. But evidently she decided that he was going \\ninto the next room, as he had to pass through hers to get \\nthere. Taking no further notice of him, she walked towards \\nthe outer door to close it and uttered a sudden scream on \\n\\uf6471\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nseeing her husband on his knees in the doorway.\\n‘Ah!’ she cried out in a frenzy, ‘he has come back! The \\ncriminal! the monster! … And where is the money? What’s \\nin your pocket, show me! And your clothes are all different! \\nWhere are your clothes? Where is the money! Speak!’\\nAnd she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively \\nand obediently held up both arms to facilitate the search.',\n",
              " 'Not a farthing was there.\\n‘Where is the money?’ she cried—‘Mercy on us, can he \\nhave drunk it all? There were twelve silver roubles left in the \\nchest!’ and in a fury she seized him by the hair and dragged \\nhim into the room. Marmeladov seconded her efforts by \\nmeekly crawling along on his knees.\\n‘And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, \\nbut is a positive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,’ he called \\nout, shaken to and fro by his hair and even once striking \\nthe ground with his forehead. The child asleep on the floor \\nwoke up, and began to cry. The boy in the corner losing all \\ncontrol began trembling and screaming and rushed to his \\nsister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was \\nshaking like a leaf.\\n‘He’s drunk it! he’s drunk it all,’ the poor woman \\nscreamed in despair —‘and his clothes are gone! And they \\nare hungry, hungry!’—and wringing her hands she point-\\ned to the children. ‘Oh, accursed life! And you, are you not \\nashamed?’—she pounced all at once upon Raskolnikov—\\n‘from the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You \\nhave been drinking with him, too! Go away!’\\nThe young man was hastening away without uttering a \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf645\\nword. The inner door was thrown wide open and inquisitive \\nfaces were peering in at it. Coarse laughing faces with pipes \\nand cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust themselves in \\nat the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in dress-\\ning gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, \\nsome of them with cards in their hands. They were particu-\\nlarly diverted, when Marmeladov, dragged about by his hair, \\nshouted that it was a consolation to him. They even began \\nto come into the room; at last a sinister shrill outcry was \\nheard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself push-\\ning her way amongst them and trying to restore order after \\nher own fashion and for the hundredth time to frighten the \\npoor woman by ordering her with coarse abuse to clear out \\nof the room next day. As he went out, Raskolnikov had time \\nto put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the coppers he \\nhad received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and \\nto lay them unnoticed on the window. Afterwards on the \\nstairs, he changed his mind and would have gone back.\\n‘What a stupid thing I’ve done,’ he thought to himself, \\n‘they have Sonia and I want it myself.’ But reflecting that \\nit would be impossible to take it back now and that in any \\ncase he would not have taken it, he dismissed it with a wave \\nof his hand and went back to his lodging. ‘Sonia wants po-\\nmatum too,’ he said as he walked along the street, and he \\nlaughed malignantly—‘such smartness costs money…. Hm! \\nAnd maybe Sonia herself will be bankrupt to-day, for there \\nis always a risk, hunting big game … digging for gold … \\nthen they would all be without a crust to-morrow except \\nfor my money. Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine they’ve dug \\n\\uf647\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthere! And they’re making the most of it! Yes, they are mak-\\ning the most of it! They’ve wept over it and grown used to it. \\nMan grows used to everything, the scoundrel!’\\nHe sank into thought.\\n‘And what if I am wrong,’ he cried suddenly after a mo-\\nment’s thought. ‘What if man is not really a scoundrel, man \\nin general, I mean, the whole race of mankind—then all the \\nrest is prejudice, simply artificial terrors and there are no \\nbarriers and it’s all as it should be.’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf647\\nChapter III\\nH\\ne waked up late next day after a broken sleep. But his \\nsleep had not refreshed him; he waked up bilious, ir-\\nritable, ill-tempered, and looked with hatred at his room. \\nIt was a tiny cupboard of a room about six paces in length. \\nIt had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty yellow \\npaper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that \\na man of more than average height was ill at ease in it and \\nfelt every moment that he would knock his head against the \\nceiling. The furniture was in keeping with the room: there \\nwere three old chairs, rather rickety; a painted table in the \\ncorner on which lay a few manuscripts and books; the dust \\nthat lay thick upon them showed that they had been long \\nuntouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole \\nof one wall and half the floor space of the room; it was once \\ncovered with chintz, but was now in rags and served Ras-\\nkolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleep on it, as he was, \\nwithout undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old \\nstudent’s overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under \\nwhich he heaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by \\nway of a bolster. A little table stood in front of the sofa.\\nIt would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of \\ndisorder, but to Raskolnikov in his present state of mind \\nthis was positively agreeable. He had got completely away \\nfrom everyone, like a tortoise in its shell, and even the sight \\n\\uf647\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nof a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked \\nsometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous \\nirritation. He was in the condition that overtakes some \\nmonomaniacs entirely concentrated upon one thing. His \\nlandlady had for the last fortnight given up sending him \\nin meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with \\nher, though he went without his dinner. Nastasya, the cook \\nand only servant, was rather pleased at the lodger’s mood \\nand had entirely given up sweeping and doing his room, \\nonly once a week or so she would stray into his room with a \\nbroom. She waked him up that day.',\n",
              " '‘Get up, why are you asleep?’ she called to him. ‘It’s past \\nnine, I have brought you some tea; will you have a cup? I \\nshould think you’re fairly starving?’\\nRaskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised \\nNastasya.\\n‘From the landlady, eh?’ he asked, slowly and with a sick-\\nly face sitting up on the sofa.\\n‘From the landlady, indeed!’\\nShe set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak \\nand stale tea and laid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side \\nof it.\\n‘Here, Nastasya, take it please,’ he said, fumbling in his \\npocket (for he had slept in his clothes) and taking out a \\nhandful of coppers—‘run and buy me a loaf. And get me a \\nlittle sausage, the cheapest, at the pork-butcher’s.’\\n‘The loaf I’ll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn’t you \\nrather have some cabbage soup instead of sausage? It’s capi-\\ntal soup, yesterday’s. I saved it for you yesterday, but you \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf649\\ncame in late. It’s fine soup.’\\nWhen the soup had been brought, and he had begun \\nupon it, Nastasya sat down beside him on the sofa and be-\\ngan chatting. She was a country peasant-woman and a very \\ntalkative one.\\n‘Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police \\nabout you,’ she said.\\nHe scowled.\\n‘To the police? What does she want?’\\n‘You don’t pay her money and you won’t turn out of the \\nroom. That’s what she wants, to be sure.’\\n‘The devil, that’s the last straw,’ he muttered, grinding his \\nteeth, ‘no, that would not suit me … just now. She is a fool,’ \\nhe added aloud. ‘I’ll go and talk to her to-day.’\\n‘Fool she is and no mistake, just as I am. But why, if you \\nare so clever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to \\nshow for it? One time you used to go out, you say, to teach \\nchildren. But why is it you do nothing now?’\\n‘I am doing …’ Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluc-\\ntantly.\\n‘What are you doing?’\\n‘Work …’\\n‘What sort of work?’\\n‘I am thinking,’ he answered seriously after a pause.\\nNastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter. She was giv-\\nen to laughter and when anything amused her, she laughed \\ninaudibly, quivering and shaking all over till she felt ill.\\n‘And have you made much money by your thinking?’ she \\nmanaged to articulate at last.\\n\\uf647\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘One can’t go out to give lessons without boots. And I’m \\nsick of it.’\\n‘Don’t quarrel with your bread and butter.’\\n‘They pay so little for lessons. What’s the use of a few cop-\\npers?’ he answered, reluctantly, as though replying to his \\nown thought.\\n‘And you want to get a fortune all at once?’\\nHe looked at her strangely.\\n‘Yes, I want a fortune,’ he answered firmly, after a brief \\npause.\\n‘Don’t be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me! Shall I \\nget you the loaf or not?’\\n‘As you please.’\\n‘Ah, I forgot! A letter came for you yesterday when you \\nwere out.’\\n‘A letter? for me! from whom?’\\n‘I can’t say. I gave three copecks of my own to the post-\\nman for it. Will you pay me back?’\\n‘Then bring it to me, for God’s sake, bring it,’ cried Ras-\\nkolnikov greatly excited—‘good God!’\\nA minute later the letter was brought him. That was it: \\nfrom his mother, from the province of R——. He turned \\npale when he took it.',\n",
              " 'It was a long while since he had re-\\nceived a letter, but another feeling also suddenly stabbed his \\nheart.\\n‘Nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness’ sake; here are \\nyour three copecks, but for goodness’ sake, make haste and \\ngo!’\\nThe letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf64b\\nto open it in her presence; he wanted to be left alone with \\nthis letter. When Nastasya had gone out, he lifted it quickly \\nto his lips and kissed it; then he gazed intently at the ad-\\ndress, the small, sloping handwriting, so dear and familiar, \\nof the mother who had once taught him to read and write. \\nHe delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something. At last \\nhe opened it; it was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two \\nounces, two large sheets of note paper were covered with \\nvery small handwriting.\\n‘My dear Rodya,’ wrote his mother—‘it’s two months \\nsince I last had a talk with you by letter which has distressed \\nme and even kept me awake at night, thinking. But I am \\nsure you will not blame me for my inevitable silence. You \\nknow how I love you; you are all we have to look to, Dounia \\nand I, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay. What a \\ngrief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the \\nuniversity some months ago, for want of means to keep \\nyourself and that you had lost your lessons and your other \\nwork! How could I help you out of my hundred and twenty \\nroubles a year pension? The fifteen roubles I sent you four \\nmonths ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my \\npension, from Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of \\nthis town. He is a kind-hearted man and was a friend of \\nyour father’s too. But having given him the right to receive \\nthe pension, I had to wait till the debt was paid off and that \\nis only just done, so that I’ve been unable to send you any-\\nthing all this time. But now, thank God, I believe I shall be \\nable to send you something more and in fact we may con-\\ngratulate ourselves on our good fortune now, of which I \\n\\uf647\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nhasten to inform you. In the first place, would you have \\nguessed, dear Rodya, that your sister has been living with \\nme for the last six weeks and we shall not be separated in \\nthe future. Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will tell \\nyou everything in order, so that you may know just how ev-\\nerything has happened and all that we have hitherto \\nconcealed from you. When you wrote to me two months \\nago that you had heard that Dounia had a great deal to put \\nup with in the Svidrigraïlovs’ house, when you wrote that \\nand asked me to tell you all about it—what could I write in \\nanswer to you? If I had written the whole truth to you, I \\ndare say you would have thrown up everything and have \\ncome to us, even if you had to walk all the way, for I know \\nyour character and your feelings, and you would not let \\nyour sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what \\ncould I do? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth \\nmyself then. What made it all so difficult was that Dounia \\nreceived a hundred roubles in advance when she took the \\nplace as governess in their family, on condition of part of \\nher salary being deducted every month, and so it was im-\\npossible to throw up the situation without repaying the \\ndebt. This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious \\nRodya) she took chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, \\nwhich you needed so terribly then and which you received \\nfrom us last year. We deceived you then, writing that this \\nmoney came from Dounia’s savings, but that was not so, \\nand now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things \\nhave suddenly changed for the better, and that you may \\nknow how Dounia loves you and what a heart she has. At \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6480\\nfirst indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treated her very rudely and \\nused to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at table…. \\nBut I don’t want to go into all those painful details, so as not \\nto worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in \\nspite of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, \\nMr. Svidrigaïlov’s wife, and all the rest of the household, \\nDounia had a very hard time, especially when Mr. Svidriga-\\nïlov, relapsing into his old regimental habits, was under the \\ninfluence of Bacchus. And how do you think it was all ex-\\nplained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow \\nhad conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, \\nbut had concealed it under a show of rudeness and con-\\ntempt. Possibly he was ashamed and horrified himself at his \\nown flighty hopes, considering his years and his being the \\nfather of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia. \\nAnd possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behav-\\niour to hide the truth from others. But at last he lost all \\ncontrol and had the face to make Dounia an open and \\nshameful proposal, promising her all sorts of inducements \\nand offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her \\nto another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all \\nshe went through! To leave her situation at once was impos-\\nsible not only on account of the money debt, but also to \\nspare the feelings of Marfa Petrovna, whose suspicions \\nwould have been aroused: and then Dounia would have \\nbeen the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would have \\nmeant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have \\nbeen inevitable. There were various other reasons owing to \\nwhich Dounia could not hope to escape from that awful \\n\\uf6481\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nhouse for another six weeks. You know Dounia, of course; \\nyou know how clever she is and what a strong will she has. \\nDounia can endure a great deal and even in the most diffi-\\ncult cases she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. \\nShe did not even write to me about everything for fear of \\nupsetting me, although we were constantly in communica-\\ntion. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa Petrovna \\naccidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in \\nthe garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on \\nthe position, threw the blame upon her, believing her to be \\nthe cause of it all. An awful scene took place between them \\non the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna went so far as to \\nstrike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was shouting \\nat her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia \\nshould be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant’s cart, \\ninto which they flung all her things, her linen and her \\nclothes, all pell-mell, without folding it up and packing it.',\n",
              " 'And a heavy shower of rain came on, too, and Dounia, in-\\nsulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an \\nopen cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think \\nnow what answer could I have sent to the letter I received \\nfrom you two months ago and what could I have written? I \\nwas in despair; I dared not write to you the truth because \\nyou would have been very unhappy, mortified and indig-\\nnant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps \\nruin yourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and \\nfill up my letter with trifles when my heart was so full of \\nsorrow, I could not. For a whole month the town was full of \\ngossip about this scandal, and it came to such a pass that \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf645\\nDounia and I dared not even go to church on account of the \\ncontemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made \\naloud about us. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody \\neven bowed to us in the street, and I learnt that some shop-\\nmen and clerks were intending to insult us in a shameful \\nway, smearing the gates of our house with pitch, so that the \\nlandlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set go-\\ning by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia \\nand throw dirt at her in every family. She knows everyone \\nin the neighbourhood, and that month she was continually \\ncoming into the town, and as she is rather talkative and \\nfond of gossiping about her family affairs and particularly \\nof complaining to all and each of her husband—which is \\nnot at all right —so in a short time she had spread her story \\nnot only in the town, but over the whole surrounding dis-\\ntrict. It made me ill, but Dounia bore it better than I did, \\nand if only you could have seen how she endured it all and \\ntried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is an angel! But by \\nGod’s mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr. Svidrigaïlov \\nreturned to his senses and repented and, probably feeling \\nsorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete \\nand unmistakable proof of Dounia’s innocence, in the form \\nof a letter Dounia had been forced to write and give to him, \\nbefore Marfa Petrovna came upon them in the garden. This \\nletter, which remained in Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s hands after her \\ndeparture, she had written to refuse personal explanations \\nand secret interviews, for which he was entreating her. In \\nthat letter she reproached him with great heat and indigna-\\ntion for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa \\n\\uf648\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nPetrovna, reminding him that he was the father and head of \\na family and telling him how infamous it was of him to tor-\\nment and make unhappy a defenceless girl, unhappy enough \\nalready. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and \\ntouchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this \\nday I cannot read it without tears. Moreover, the evidence \\nof the servants, too, cleared Dounia’s reputation; they had \\nseen and known a great deal more than Mr. Svidrigaïlov \\nhad himself supposed —as indeed is always the case with \\nservants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and \\n‘again crushed’ as she said herself to us, but she was com-\\npletely convinced of Dounia’s innocence. The very next day, \\nbeing Sunday, she went straight to the Cathedral, knelt \\ndown and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give her strength \\nto bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she came \\nstraight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, \\nwept bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and \\nbesought her to forgive her. The same morning without any \\ndelay, she went round to all the houses in the town and ev-\\nerywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in the most flattering \\nterms Dounia’s innocence and the nobility of her feelings \\nand her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to \\neveryone the letter in Dounia’s own handwriting to Mr. \\nSvidrigaïlov and even allowed them to take copies of it—\\nwhich I must say I think was superfluous. In this way she \\nwas busy for several days in driving about the whole town, \\nbecause some people had taken offence through precedence \\nhaving been given to others. And therefore they had to take \\nturns, so that in every house she was expected before she ar-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf647\\nrived, and everyone knew that on such and such a day \\nMarfa Petrovna would be reading the letter in such and \\nsuch a place and people assembled for every reading of it, \\neven many who had heard it several times already both in \\ntheir own houses and in other people’s. In my opinion a \\ngreat deal, a very great deal of all this was unnecessary; but \\nthat’s Marfa Petrovna’s character. Anyway she succeeded in \\ncompletely re-establishing Dounia’s reputation and the \\nwhole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible disgrace \\nupon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I re-\\nally began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the \\ncrazy fellow too harshly. Dounia was at once asked to give \\nlessons in several families, but she refused. All of a sudden \\neveryone began to treat her with marked respect and all \\nthis did much to bring about the event by which, one may \\nsay, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must \\nknow, dear Rodya, that Dounia has a suitor and that she has \\nalready consented to marry him. I hasten to tell you all \\nabout the matter, and though it has been arranged without \\nasking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved with \\nme or with your sister on that account, for you will see that \\nwe could not wait and put off our decision till we heard \\nfrom you. And you could not have judged all the facts with-\\nout being on the spot. This was how it happened. He is \\nalready of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, \\nand is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who has been \\nvery active in bringing the match about. It began with his \\nexpressing through her his desire to make our acquain-\\ntance. He was properly received, drank coffee with us and \\n\\uf648\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthe very next day he sent us a letter in which he very courte-\\nously made an offer and begged for a speedy and decided \\nanswer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry to get \\nto Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At \\nfirst, of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all hap-\\npened so quickly and unexpectedly. We thought and talked \\nit over the whole day. He is a well-to-do man, to be depend-\\ned upon, he has two posts in the government and has already \\nmade his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years old, but \\nhe is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be \\nthought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very re-\\nspectable and presentable man, only he seems a little morose \\nand somewhat conceited.',\n",
              " 'But possibly that may only be the \\nimpression he makes at first sight. And beware, dear Rodya, \\nwhen he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will do, beware \\nof judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if \\nthere is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give \\nyou this warning, although I feel sure that he will make a \\nfavourable impression upon you. Moreover, in order to un-\\nderstand any man one must be deliberate and careful to \\navoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas, which are \\nvery difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr \\nPetrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly es-\\ntimable man. At his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was \\na practical man, but still he shares, as he expressed it, many \\nof the convictions ‘of our most rising generation’ and he is \\nan opponent of all prejudices. He said a good deal more, for \\nhe seems a little conceited and likes to be listened to, but \\nthis is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very little of \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf649\\nit, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man \\nof great education, he is clever and seems to be good-na-\\ntured. You know your sister’s character, Rodya. She is a \\nresolute, sensible, patient and generous girl, but she has a \\npassionate heart, as I know very well. Of course, there is no \\ngreat love either on his side, or on hers, but Dounia is a clev-\\ner girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make it her \\nduty to make her husband happy who on his side will make \\nher happiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to \\ndoubt, though it must be admitted the matter has been ar-\\nranged in great haste. Besides he is a man of great prudence \\nand he will see, to be sure, of himself, that his own happi-\\nness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with \\nhim. And as for some defects of character, for some habits \\nand even certain differences of opinion —which indeed are \\ninevitable even in the happiest marriages— Dounia has \\nsaid that, as regards all that, she relies on herself, that there \\nis nothing to be uneasy about, and that she is ready to put \\nup with a great deal, if only their future relationship can be \\nan honourable and straightforward one. He struck me, for \\ninstance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come \\nfrom his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how \\nit is. For instance, at his second visit, after he had received \\nDounia’s consent, in the course of conversation, he declared \\nthat before making Dounia’s acquaintance, he had made up \\nhis mind to marry a girl of good reputation, without dowry \\nand, above all, one who had experienced poverty, because, \\nas he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his wife, \\nbut that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as \\n\\uf648\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nher benefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely \\nand politely than I have done, for I have forgotten his actual \\nphrases and only remember the meaning. And, besides, it \\nwas obviously not said of design, but slipped out in the heat \\nof conversation, so that he tried afterwards to correct him-\\nself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike me as \\nsomewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But \\nDounia was vexed, and answered that ‘words are not deeds,’ \\nand that, of course, is perfectly true. Dounia did not sleep \\nall night before she made up her mind, and, thinking that I \\nwas asleep, she got out of bed and was walking up and down \\nthe room all night; at last she knelt down before the ikon \\nand prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told \\nme that she had decided.\\n‘I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just \\nsetting off for Petersburg, where he has a great deal of busi-\\nness, and he wants to open a legal bureau. He has been \\noccupied for many years in conducting civil and commer-\\ncial litigation, and only the other day he won an important \\ncase. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an impor-\\ntant case before the Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the \\ngreatest use to you, in every way indeed, and Dounia and I \\nhave agreed that from this very day you could definitely en-\\nter upon your career and might consider that your future is \\nmarked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes to \\npass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look \\nupon it as a providential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of \\nnothing else. We have even ventured already to drop a few \\nwords on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch. He was cautious in \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf64b\\nhis answer, and said that, of course, as he could not get on \\nwithout a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary \\nto a relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted \\nfor the duties (as though there could be doubt of your being \\nfitted!) but then he expressed doubts whether your studies \\nat the university would leave you time for work at his office. \\nThe matter dropped for the time, but Dounia is thinking of \\nnothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever for the last \\nfew days, and has already made a regular plan for your be-\\ncoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr \\nPetrovitch’s business, which might well be, seeing that you \\nare a student of law. I am in complete agreement with her, \\nRodya, and share all her plans and hopes, and think there \\nis every probability of realising them. And in spite of Pyotr \\nPetrovitch’s evasiveness, very natural at present (since he \\ndoes not know you), Dounia is firmly persuaded that she \\nwill gain everything by her good influence over her future \\nhusband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are care-\\nful not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr \\nPetrovitch, especially of your becoming his partner. He is a \\npractical man and might take this very coldly, it might all \\nseem to him simply a day-dream. Nor has either Dounia or \\nI breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have of his \\nhelping us to pay for your university studies; we have not \\nspoken of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of \\nitself, later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words \\noffer to do it of himself, (as though he could refuse Dounia \\nthat) the more readily since you may by your own efforts be-\\ncome his right hand in the office, and receive this assistance \\n\\uf648\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nnot as a charity, but as a salary earned by your own work. \\nDounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree \\nwith her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another \\nreason, that is, because I particularly wanted you to feel on \\nan equal footing when you first meet him. When Dounia \\nspoke to him with enthusiasm about you, he answered that \\none could never judge of a man without seeing him close, \\nfor oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own \\nopinion when he makes your acquaintance.',\n",
              " 'Do you know, \\nmy precious Rodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons \\n(nothing to do with Pyotr Petrovitch though, simply for my \\nown personal, perhaps old- womanish, fancies) I should do \\nbetter to go on living by myself, apart, than with them, af-\\nter the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous \\nand delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain \\nwith my daughter for the future, and if he has said nothing \\nabout it hitherto, it is simply because it has been taken for \\ngranted; but I shall refuse. I have noticed more than once \\nin my life that husbands don’t quite get on with their moth-\\ners-in- law, and I don’t want to be the least bit in anyone’s \\nway, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite inde-\\npendent, so long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and \\nsuch children as you and Dounia. If possible, I would set-\\ntle somewhere near you, for the most joyful piece of news, \\ndear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter: know then, \\nmy dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a very \\nshort time and may embrace one another again after a sep-\\naration of almost three years! It is settled for certain that \\nDounia and I are to set off for Petersburg, exactly when I \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6490\\ndon’t know, but very, very soon, possibly in a week. It all \\ndepends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us know when he \\nhas had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit his \\nown arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as \\nsoon as possible, even before the fast of Our Lady, if it could \\nbe managed, or if that is too soon to be ready, immediate-\\nly after. Oh, with what happiness I shall press you to my \\nheart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought of see-\\ning you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to \\nmarry Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She \\nis not writing anything to you now, and has only told me \\nto write that she has so much, so much to tell you that she \\nis not going to take up her pen now, for a few lines would \\ntell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting herself; \\nshe bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. But \\nalthough we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send \\nyou as much money as I can in a day or two. Now that ev-\\neryone has heard that Dounia is to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, \\nmy credit has suddenly improved and I know that Afanasy \\nIvanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles \\non the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able \\nto send you twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send \\nyou more, but I am uneasy about our travelling expenses; \\nfor though Pyotr Petrovitch has been so kind as to under-\\ntake part of the expenses of the journey, that is to say, he \\nhas taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big \\ntrunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintanc-\\nes of his), we must reckon upon some expense on our arrival \\nin Petersburg, where we can’t be left without a halfpenny, \\n\\uf6491\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nat least for the first few days. But we have calculated it all, \\nDounia and I, to the last penny, and we see that the journey \\nwill not cost very much. It is only ninety versts from us to \\nthe railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver \\nwe know, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia \\nand I can travel quite comfortably third class. So that I may \\nvery likely be able to send to you not twenty-five, but thir-\\nty roubles. But enough; I have covered two sheets already \\nand there is no space left for more; our whole history, but \\nso many events have happened! And now, my precious Ro-\\ndya, I embrace you and send you a mother’s blessing till we \\nmeet. Love Dounia your sister, Rodya; love her as she loves \\nyou and understand that she loves you beyond everything, \\nmore than herself. She is an angel and you, Rodya, you are \\neverything to us—our one hope, our one consolation. If \\nonly you are happy, we shall be happy. Do you still say your \\nprayers, Rodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and \\nour Redeemer? I am afraid in my heart that you may have \\nbeen visited by the new spirit of infidelity that is abroad to-\\nday; If it is so, I pray for you. Remember, dear boy, how in \\nyour childhood, when your father was living, you used to \\nlisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in \\nthose days. Good-bye, till we meet then— I embrace you \\nwarmly, warmly, with many kisses.\\n‘Yours till death,\\n‘PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV.’\\nAlmost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskol-\\nnikov’s face was wet with tears; but when he finished it, his \\nface was pale and distorted and a bitter, wrathful and ma-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf645\\nlignant smile was on his lips. He laid his head down on his \\nthreadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a long \\ntime. His heart was beating violently, and his brain was in a \\nturmoil. At last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yel-\\nlow room that was like a cupboard or a box. His eyes and \\nhis mind craved for space. He took up his hat and went out, \\nthis time without dread of meeting anyone; he had forgot-\\nten his dread. He turned in the direction of the Vassilyevsky \\nOstrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as though \\nhastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit \\nwas, without noticing his way, muttering and even speak-\\ning aloud to himself, to the astonishment of the passers-by. \\nMany of them took him to be drunk.\\n\\uf649\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter IV\\nH\\nis mother’s letter had been a torture to him, but as re-\\ngards the chief fact in it, he had felt not one moment’s \\nhesitation, even whilst he was reading the letter. The es-\\nsential question was settled, and irrevocably settled, in his \\nmind: ‘Never such a marriage while I am alive and Mr. Lu-\\nzhin be damned!’ ‘The thing is perfectly clear,’ he muttered \\nto himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph \\nof his decision. ‘No, mother, no, Dounia, you won’t deceive \\nme! and then they apologise for not asking my advice and \\nfor taking the decision without me! I dare say! They imagine \\nit is arranged now and can’t be broken off; but we will see \\nwhether it can or not! A magnificent excuse: ‘Pyotr Petro-\\nvitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in \\npost-haste, almost by express.’ No, Dounia, I see it all and \\nI know what you want to say to me; and I know too what \\nyou were thinking about, when you walked up and down \\nall night, and what your prayers were like before the Holy \\nMother of Kazan who stands in mother’s bedroom. Bitter is \\nthe ascent to Golgotha…. Hm … so it is finally settled; you \\nhave determined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya \\nRomanovna, one who has a fortune (has already made his \\nfortune, that is so much more solid and impressive) a man \\nwho holds two government posts and who shares the ideas \\nof our most rising generation, as mother writes, and who \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf647\\nseems to be kind, as Dounia herself observes. That seems \\nbeats everything! And that very Dounia for that very ‘seems’ \\nis marrying him! Splendid! splendid!\\n‘… But I should like to know why mother has written to \\nme about ‘our most rising generation’? Simply as a descrip-\\ntive touch, or with the idea of prepossessing me in favour \\nof Mr.',\n",
              " 'Luzhin? Oh, the cunning of them! I should like to \\nknow one thing more: how far they were open with one an-\\nother that day and night and all this time since? Was it all \\nput into words or did both understand that they had the \\nsame thing at heart and in their minds, so that there was \\nno need to speak of it aloud, and better not to speak of it. \\nMost likely it was partly like that, from mother’s letter it’s \\nevident: he struck her as rude a little and mother in her sim-\\nplicity took her observations to Dounia. And she was sure \\nto be vexed and ‘answered her angrily.’ I should think so! \\nWho would not be angered when it was quite clear without \\nany naïve questions and when it was understood that it was \\nuseless to discuss it. And why does she write to me, ‘love \\nDounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than herself’? Has \\nshe a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter to \\nher son? ‘You are our one comfort, you are everything to \\nus.’ Oh, mother!’\\nHis bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he \\nhad happened to meet Mr. Luzhin at the moment, he might \\nhave murdered him.\\n‘Hm … yes, that’s true,’ he continued, pursuing the \\nwhirling ideas that chased each other in his brain, ‘it is \\ntrue that ‘it needs time and care to get to know a man,’ but \\n\\uf649\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthere is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin. The chief thing is \\nhe is ‘a man of business and seems kind,’ that was some-\\nthing, wasn’t it, to send the bags and big box for them! A \\nkind man, no doubt after that! But his bride and her moth-\\ner are to drive in a peasant’s cart covered with sacking (I \\nknow, I have been driven in it). No matter! It is only nine-\\nty versts and then they can ‘travel very comfortably, third \\nclass,’ for a thousand versts! Quite right, too. One must cut \\none’s coat according to one’s cloth, but what about you, Mr. \\nLuzhin? She is your bride…. And you must be aware that \\nher mother has to raise money on her pension for the jour-\\nney. To be sure it’s a matter of business, a partnership for \\nmutual benefit, with equal shares and expenses;—food and \\ndrink provided, but pay for your tobacco. The business man \\nhas got the better of them, too. The luggage will cost less \\nthan their fares and very likely go for nothing. How is it that \\nthey don’t both see all that, or is it that they don’t want to \\nsee? And they are pleased, pleased! And to think that this \\nis only the first blossoming, and that the real fruits are to \\ncome! But what really matters is not the stinginess, is not \\nthe meanness, but the tone of the whole thing. For that will \\nbe the tone after marriage, it’s a foretaste of it. And mother \\ntoo, why should she be so lavish? What will she have by the \\ntime she gets to Petersburg? Three silver roubles or two ‘pa-\\nper ones’ as she says…. that old woman … hm. What does \\nshe expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards? She has \\nher reasons already for guessing that she could not live with \\nDounia after the marriage, even for the first few months. \\nThe good man has no doubt let slip something on that sub-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf649\\nject also, though mother would deny it: ‘I shall refuse,’ says \\nshe. On whom is she reckoning then? Is she counting on \\nwhat is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension \\nwhen Afanasy Ivanovitch’s debt is paid? She knits woollen \\nshawls and embroiders cuffs, ruining her old eyes. And all \\nher shawls don’t add more than twenty roubles a year to \\nher hundred and twenty, I know that. So she is building all \\nher hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhin’s generosity; ‘he will \\noffer it of himself, he will press it on me.’ You may wait a \\nlong time for that! That’s how it always is with these Schil-\\nleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is \\na swan with them, till the last moment, they hope for the \\nbest and will see nothing wrong, and although they have an \\ninkling of the other side of the picture, yet they won’t face \\nthe truth till they are forced to; the very thought of it makes \\nthem shiver; they thrust the truth away with both hands, \\nuntil the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool’s cap \\non them with his own hands. I should like to know whether \\nMr. Luzhin has any orders of merit; I bet he has the Anna in \\nhis buttonhole and that he puts it on when he goes to dine \\nwith contractors or merchants. He will be sure to have it for \\nhis wedding, too! Enough of him, confound him!\\n‘Well, … mother I don’t wonder at, it’s like her, God bless \\nher, but how could Dounia? Dounia darling, as though I \\ndid not know you! You were nearly twenty when I saw you \\nlast: I understood you then. Mother writes that ‘Dounia \\ncan put up with a great deal.’ I know that very well. I knew \\nthat two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a \\nhalf years I have been thinking about it, thinking of just \\n\\uf649\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthat, that ‘Dounia can put up with a great deal.’ If she could \\nput up with Mr. Svidrigaïlov and all the rest of it, she cer-\\ntainly can put up with a great deal. And now mother and \\nshe have taken it into their heads that she can put up with \\nMr. Luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority \\nof wives raised from destitution and owing everything to \\ntheir husband’s bounty—who propounds it, too, almost at \\nthe first interview.',\n",
              " 'Granted that he ‘let it slip,’ though he \\nis a sensible man, (yet maybe it was not a slip at all, but he \\nmeant to make himself clear as soon as possible) but Dou-\\nnia, Dounia? She understands the man, of course, but she \\nwill have to live with the man. Why! she’d live on black \\nbread and water, she would not sell her soul, she would not \\nbarter her moral freedom for comfort; she would not barter \\nit for all Schleswig-Holstein, much less Mr. Luzhin’s money. \\nNo, Dounia was not that sort when I knew her and … she is \\nstill the same, of course! Yes, there’s no denying, the Svid-\\nrigaïlovs are a bitter pill! It’s a bitter thing to spend one’s life \\na governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles, but I \\nknow she would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett \\nwith a German master than degrade her soul, and her mor-\\nal dignity, by binding herself for ever to a man whom she \\ndoes not respect and with whom she has nothing in com-\\nmon—for her own advantage. And if Mr. Luzhin had been \\nof unalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she would never \\nhave consented to become his legal concubine. Why is she \\nconsenting then? What’s the point of it? What’s the answer? \\nIt’s clear enough: for herself, for her comfort, to save her life \\nshe would not sell herself, but for someone else she is doing \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf64b\\nit! For one she loves, for one she adores, she will sell herself! \\nThat’s what it all amounts to; for her brother, for her mother, \\nshe will sell herself! She will sell everything! In such cases, \\n‘we overcome our moral feeling if necessary,’ freedom, peace, \\nconscience even, all, all are brought into the market. Let my \\nlife go, if only my dear ones may be happy! More than that, \\nwe become casuists, we learn to be Jesuitical and for a time \\nmaybe we can soothe ourselves, we can persuade ourselves \\nthat it is one’s duty for a good object. That’s just like us, it’s \\nas clear as daylight. It’s clear that Rodion Romanovitch Ras-\\nkolnikov is the central figure in the business, and no one \\nelse. Oh, yes, she can ensure his happiness, keep him in the \\nuniversity, make him a partner in the office, make his whole \\nfuture secure; perhaps he may even be a rich man later on, \\nprosperous, respected, and may even end his life a famous \\nman! But my mother? It’s all Rodya, precious Rodya, her \\nfirst born! For such a son who would not sacrifice such a \\ndaughter! Oh, loving, over-partial hearts! Why, for his sake \\nwe would not shrink even from Sonia’s fate. Sonia, Sonia \\nMarmeladov, the eternal victim so long as the world lasts. \\nHave you taken the measure of your sacrifice, both of you? \\nIs it right? Can you bear it? Is it any use? Is there sense in it? \\nAnd let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia’s life is no worse than life \\nwith Mr. Luzhin. ‘There can be no question of love,’ mother \\nwrites. And what if there can be no respect either, if on the \\ncontrary there is aversion, contempt, repulsion, what then? \\nSo you will have to ‘keep up your appearance,’ too. Is not \\nthat so? Do you understand what that smartness means? Do \\nyou understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same \\n\\uf649\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthing as Sonia’s and may be worse, viler, baser, because in \\nyour case, Dounia, it’s a bargain for luxuries, after all, but \\nwith Sonia it’s simply a question of starvation. It has to be \\npaid for, it has to be paid for, Dounia, this smartness. And \\nwhat if it’s more than you can bear afterwards, if you regret \\nit? The bitterness, the misery, the curses, the tears hidden \\nfrom all the world, for you are not a Marfa Petrovna. And \\nhow will your mother feel then? Even now she is uneasy, \\nshe is worried, but then, when she sees it all clearly? And I? \\nYes, indeed, what have you taken me for? I won’t have your \\nsacrifice, Dounia, I won’t have it, mother! It shall not be, so \\nlong as I am alive, it shall not, it shall not! I won’t accept it!’\\nHe suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still.\\n‘It shall not be? But what are you going to do to prevent \\nit? You’ll forbid it? And what right have you? What can you \\npromise them on your side to give you such a right? Your \\nwhole life, your whole future, you will devote to them when \\nyou have finished your studies and obtained a post? Yes, we \\nhave heard all that before, and that’s all words but now? Now \\nsomething must be done, now, do you understand that? \\nAnd what are you doing now? You are living upon them. \\nThey borrow on their hundred roubles pension.

Can you fancy?’\\nSo he tortured himself, fretting himself with such ques-\\ntions, and finding a kind of enjoyment in it. And yet all \\nthese questions were not new ones suddenly confronting \\nhim, they were old familiar aches. It was long since they had \\nfirst begun to grip and rend his heart. Long, long ago his \\npresent anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed and \\ngathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, un-\\ntil it had taken the form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic \\nquestion, which tortured his heart and mind, clamouring \\ninsistently for an answer. Now his mother’s letter had burst \\non him like a thunderclap. It was clear that he must not \\nnow suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolved ques-\\ntions, but that he must do something, do it at once, and do it \\nquickly. Anyway he must decide on something, or else …\\n‘Or throw up life altogether!’ he cried suddenly, in a fren-\\nzy—‘accept one’s lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle \\neverything in oneself, giving up all claim to activity, life \\nand love!’\\n‘Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means \\nwhen you have absolutely nowhere to turn?’ Marmeladov’s \\nquestion came suddenly into his mind, ‘for every man must \\nhave somewhere to turn….’\\nHe gave a sudden start; another thought, that he had had \\nyesterday, slipped back into his mind. But he did not start at \\nthe thought recurring to him, for he knew, he had felt before-\\nhand that it must come back, he was expecting it; besides it \\nwas not only yesterday’s thought. The difference was that a \\n\\uf64a1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nmonth ago, yesterday even, the thought was a mere dream: \\nbut now … now it appeared not a dream at all, it had taken a \\nnew menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenly \\nbecame aware of this himself…. He felt a hammering in his \\nhead, and there was a darkness before his eyes.\\nHe looked round hurriedly, he was searching for some-\\nthing. He wanted to sit down and was looking for a seat; he \\nwas walking along the K—— Boulevard. There was a seat \\nabout a hundred paces in front of him.',\n",
              " 'He walked towards \\nit as fast he could; but on the way he met with a little ad-\\nventure which absorbed all his attention. Looking for the \\nseat, he had noticed a woman walking some twenty paces \\nin front of him, but at first he took no more notice of her \\nthan of other objects that crossed his path. It had happened \\nto him many times going home not to notice the road by \\nwhich he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like \\nthat. But there was at first sight something so strange about \\nthe woman in front of him, that gradually his attention was \\nriveted upon her, at first reluctantly and, as it were, resent-\\nfully, and then more and more intently. He felt a sudden \\ndesire to find out what it was that was so strange about the \\nwoman. In the first place, she appeared to be a girl quite \\nyoung, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded \\nand with no parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in \\nan absurd way. She had on a dress of some light silky ma-\\nterial, but put on strangely awry, not properly hooked up, \\nand torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the waist: a \\ngreat piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief \\nwas flung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf645\\nside. The girl was walking unsteadily, too, stumbling and \\nstaggering from side to side. She drew Raskolnikov’s whole \\nattention at last. He overtook the girl at the seat, but, on \\nreaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner; she let \\nher head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes, ap-\\nparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely, he \\nsaw at once that she was completely drunk. It was a strange \\nand shocking sight. He could hardly believe that he was not \\nmistaken. He saw before him the face of a quite young, fair-\\nhaired girl—sixteen, perhaps not more than fifteen, years \\nold, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking and, as \\nit were, swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she \\nwas doing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it inde-\\ncorously, and showed every sign of being unconscious that \\nshe was in the street.\\nRaskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to \\nleave her, and stood facing her in perplexity. This boulevard \\nwas never much frequented; and now, at two o’clock, in the \\nstifling heat, it was quite deserted. And yet on the further \\nside of the boulevard, about fifteen paces away, a gentleman \\nwas standing on the edge of the pavement. He, too, would \\napparently have liked to approach the girl with some object \\nof his own. He, too, had probably seen her in the distance \\nand had followed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way. He \\nlooked angrily at him, though he tried to escape his notice, \\nand stood impatiently biding his time, till the unwelcome \\nman in rags should have moved away. His intentions were \\nunmistakable. The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set man, \\nabout thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red \\n\\uf64a\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nlips and moustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sud-\\nden longing to insult this fat dandy in some way. He left the \\ngirl for a moment and walked towards the gentleman.\\n‘Hey! You Svidrigaïlov! What do you want here?’ he \\nshouted, clenching his fists and laughing, spluttering with \\nrage.\\n‘What do you mean?’ the gentleman asked sternly, scowl-\\ning in haughty astonishment.\\n‘Get away, that’s what I mean.’\\n‘How dare you, you low fellow!’\\nHe raised his cane. Raskolnikov rushed at him with \\nhis fists, without reflecting that the stout gentleman was a \\nmatch for two men like himself. But at that instant some-\\none seized him from behind, and a police constable stood \\nbetween them.\\n‘That’s enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public \\nplace. What do you want? Who are you?’ he asked Raskol-\\nnikov sternly, noticing his rags.\\nRaskolnikov looked at him intently. He had a straight-\\nforward, sensible, soldierly face, with grey moustaches and \\nwhiskers.\\n‘You are just the man I want,’ Raskolnikov cried, catch-\\ning at his arm. ‘I am a student, Raskolnikov…. You may as \\nwell know that too,’ he added, addressing the gentleman, \\n‘come along, I have something to show you.',\n",
              " '’\\nAnd taking the policeman by the hand he drew him to-\\nwards the seat.\\n‘Look here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come \\ndown the boulevard. There is no telling who and what she \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf647\\nis, she does not look like a professional. It’s more likely \\nshe has been given drink and deceived somewhere … for \\nthe first time … you understand? and they’ve put her out \\ninto the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn, \\nand the way it has been put on: she has been dressed by \\nsomebody, she has not dressed herself, and dressed by un-\\npractised hands, by a man’s hands; that’s evident. And now \\nlook there: I don’t know that dandy with whom I was going \\nto fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen her \\non the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is do-\\ning, and now he is very eager to get hold of her, to get her \\naway somewhere while she is in this state … that’s certain, \\nbelieve me, I am not wrong. I saw him myself watching her \\nand following her, but I prevented him, and he is just wait-\\ning for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little, and \\nis standing still, pretending to make a cigarette…. Think \\nhow can we keep her out of his hands, and how are we to \\nget her home?’\\nThe policeman saw it all in a flash. The stout gentleman \\nwas easy to understand, he turned to consider the girl. The \\npoliceman bent over to examine her more closely, and his \\nface worked with genuine compassion.\\n‘Ah, what a pity!’ he said, shaking his head—‘why, she \\nis quite a child! She has been deceived, you can see that at \\nonce. Listen, lady,’ he began addressing her, ‘where do you \\nlive?’ The girl opened her weary and sleepy-looking eyes, \\ngazed blankly at the speaker and waved her hand.\\n‘Here,’ said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding \\ntwenty copecks, ‘here, call a cab and tell him to drive her to \\n\\uf64a\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nher address. The only thing is to find out her address!’\\n‘Missy, missy!’ the policeman began again, taking the \\nmoney. ‘I’ll fetch you a cab and take you home myself. \\nWhere shall I take you, eh? Where do you live?’\\n‘Go away! They won’t let me alone,’ the girl muttered, and \\nonce more waved her hand.\\n‘Ach, ach, how shocking! It’s shameful, missy, it’s a \\nshame!’ He shook his head again, shocked, sympathetic and \\nindignant.\\n‘It’s a difficult job,’ the policeman said to Raskolnikov, \\nand as he did so, he looked him up and down in a rapid \\nglance. He, too, must have seemed a strange figure to him: \\ndressed in rags and handing him money!\\n‘Did you meet her far from here?’ he asked him.\\n‘I tell you she was walking in front of me, staggering, just \\nhere, in the boulevard. She only just reached the seat and \\nsank down on it.’\\n‘Ah, the shameful things that are done in the world now-\\nadays, God have mercy on us! An innocent creature like \\nthat, drunk already! She has been deceived, that’s a sure \\nthing. See how her dress has been torn too…. Ah, the vice \\none sees nowadays! And as likely as not she belongs to gen-\\ntlefolk too, poor ones maybe…. There are many like that \\nnowadays. She looks refined, too, as though she were a lady,’ \\nand he bent over her once more.\\nPerhaps he had daughters growing up like that, ‘look-\\ning like ladies and refined’ with pretensions to gentility and \\nsmartness….\\n‘The chief thing is,’ Raskolnikov persisted, ‘to keep her \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf649\\nout of this scoundrel’s hands! Why should he outrage her! \\nIt’s as clear as day what he is after; ah, the brute, he is not \\nmoving off!’\\nRaskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him. The gen-\\ntleman heard him, and seemed about to fly into a rage again, \\nbut thought better of it, and confined himself to a contemp-\\ntuous look. He then walked slowly another ten paces away \\nand again halted.\\n‘Keep her out of his hands we can,’ said the constable \\nthoughtfully, ‘if only she’d tell us where to take her, but as it \\nis…. Missy, hey, missy!’ he bent over her once more.\\nShe opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him \\nintently, as though realising something, got up from the \\nseat and walked away in the direction from which she had \\ncome. ‘Oh shameful wretches, they won’t let me alone!’ she \\nsaid, waving her hand again. She walked quickly, though \\nstaggering as before. The dandy followed her, but along an-\\nother avenue, keeping his eye on her.\\n‘Don’t be anxious, I won’t let him have her,’ the police-\\nman said resolutely, and he set off after them.\\n‘Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!’ he repeated aloud, sigh-\\ning.',\n",
              " 'At that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; \\nin an instant a complete revulsion of feeling came over \\nhim.\\n‘Hey, here!’ he shouted after the policeman.\\nThe latter turned round.\\n‘Let them be! What is it to do with you? Let her go! Let \\nhim amuse himself.’ He pointed at the dandy, ‘What is it to \\n\\uf64a\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ndo with you?’\\nThe policeman was bewildered, and stared at him open-\\neyed. Raskolnikov laughed.\\n‘Well!’ ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of \\ncontempt, and he walked after the dandy and the girl, prob-\\nably taking Raskolnikov for a madman or something even \\nworse.\\n‘He has carried off my twenty copecks,’ Raskolnikov \\nmurmured angrily when he was left alone. ‘Well, let him \\ntake as much from the other fellow to allow him to have the \\ngirl and so let it end. And why did I want to interfere? Is it \\nfor me to help? Have I any right to help? Let them devour \\neach other alive—what is to me? How did I dare to give him \\ntwenty copecks? Were they mine?’\\nIn spite of those strange words he felt very wretched. He \\nsat down on the deserted seat. His thoughts strayed aim-\\nlessly…. He found it hard to fix his mind on anything at that \\nmoment. He longed to forget himself altogether, to forget \\neverything, and then to wake up and begin life anew….\\n‘Poor girl!’ he said, looking at the empty corner where \\nshe had sat— ‘She will come to herself and weep, and then \\nher mother will find out…. She will give her a beating, a \\nhorrible, shameful beating and then maybe, turn her out of \\ndoors…. And even if she does not, the Darya Frantsovnas \\nwill get wind of it, and the girl will soon be slipping out on \\nthe sly here and there. Then there will be the hospital di-\\nrectly (that’s always the luck of those girls with respectable \\nmothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then … again the \\nhospital … drink … the taverns … and more hospital, in \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf64b\\ntwo or three years—a wreck, and her life over at eighteen or \\nnineteen…. Have not I seen cases like that? And how have \\nthey been brought to it? Why, they’ve all come to it like that. \\nUgh! But what does it matter? That’s as it should be, they \\ntell us. A certain percentage, they tell us, must every year go \\n… that way … to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may \\nremain chaste, and not be interfered with. A percentage! \\nWhat splendid words they have; they are so scientific, so \\nconsolatory…. Once you’ve said ‘percentage’ there’s nothing \\nmore to worry about. If we had any other word … maybe we \\nmight feel more uneasy…. But what if Dounia were one of \\nthe percentage! Of another one if not that one?\\n‘But where am I going?’ he thought suddenly. ‘Strange, \\nI came out for something. As soon as I had read the letter \\nI came out…. I was going to Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Ra-\\nzumihin. That’s what it was … now I remember. What for, \\nthough? And what put the idea of going to Razumihin into \\nmy head just now? That’s curious.’\\nHe wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his old \\ncomrades at the university. It was remarkable that Raskol-\\nnikov had hardly any friends at the university; he kept aloof \\nfrom everyone, went to see no one, and did not welcome \\nanyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon \\ngave him up. He took no part in the students’ gatherings, \\namusements or conversations. He worked with great inten-\\nsity without sparing himself, and he was respected for this, \\nbut no one liked him. He was very poor, and there was a \\nsort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though he \\nwere keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of \\n\\uf64a\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nhis comrades to look down upon them all as children, as \\nthough he were superior in development, knowledge and \\nconvictions, as though their beliefs and interests were be-\\nneath him.\\nWith Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more \\nunreserved and communicative with him.',\n",
              " 'Indeed it was \\nimpossible to be on any other terms with Razumihin. He \\nwas an exceptionally good-humoured and candid youth, \\ngood-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth \\nand dignity lay concealed under that simplicity. The better \\nof his comrades understood this, and all were fond of him. \\nHe was extremely intelligent, though he was certainly rath-\\ner a simpleton at times. He was of striking appearance—tall, \\nthin, blackhaired and always badly shaved. He was some-\\ntimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical \\nstrength. One night, when out in a festive company, he had \\nwith one blow laid a gigantic policeman on his back. There \\nwas no limit to his drinking powers, but he could abstain \\nfrom drink altogether; he sometimes went too far in his \\npranks; but he could do without pranks altogether. Another \\nthing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, \\nand it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances \\ncould crush him. He could lodge anywhere, and bear the \\nextremes of cold and hunger. He was very poor, and kept \\nhimself entirely on what he could earn by work of one sort \\nor another. He knew of no end of resources by which to \\nearn money. He spent one whole winter without lighting \\nhis stove, and used to declare that he liked it better, because \\none slept more soundly in the cold. For the present he, too, \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64b0\\nhad been obliged to give up the university, but it was only \\nfor a time, and he was working with all his might to save \\nenough to return to his studies again. Raskolnikov had not \\nbeen to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin \\ndid not even know his address. About two months before, \\nthey had met in the street, but Raskolnikov had turned \\naway and even crossed to the other side that he might not be \\nobserved. And though Razumihin noticed him, he passed \\nhim by, as he did not want to annoy him.\\n\\uf64b1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter V\\n‘O\\nf course, I’ve been meaning lately to go to Razumi-\\nhin’s to ask for work, to ask him to get me lessons or \\nsomething …’ Raskolnikov thought, ‘but what help can \\nhe be to me now? Suppose he gets me lessons, suppose he \\nshares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so \\nthat I could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to \\ngive lessons … hm … Well and what then? What shall I do \\nwith the few coppers I earn? That’s not what I want now. It’s \\nreally absurd for me to go to Razumihin….’\\nThe question why he was now going to Razumihin agi-\\ntated him even more than he was himself aware; he kept \\nuneasily seeking for some sinister significance in this ap-\\nparently ordinary action.\\n‘Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a \\nway out by means of Razumihin alone?’ he asked himself \\nin perplexity.\\nHe pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to \\nsay, after long musing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously \\nand by chance, a fantastic thought came into his head.\\n‘Hm … to Razumihin’s,’ he said all at once, calmly, as \\nthough he had reached a final determination. ‘I shall go to \\nRazumihin’s of course, but … not now. I shall go to him … \\non the next day after It, when It will be over and everything \\nwill begin afresh….’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64b\\uf645\\nAnd suddenly he realised what he was thinking.\\n‘After It,’ he shouted, jumping up from the seat, ‘but is It \\nreally going to happen? Is it possible it really will happen?’ \\nHe left the seat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to \\nturn back, homewards, but the thought of going home sud-\\ndenly filled him with intense loathing; in that hole, in that \\nawful little cupboard of his, all this had for a month past \\nbeen growing up in him; and he walked on at random.\\nHis nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made \\nhim feel shivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold. With a \\nkind of effort he began almost unconsciously, from some in-\\nner craving, to stare at all the objects before him, as though \\nlooking for something to distract his attention; but he did \\nnot succeed, and kept dropping every moment into brood-\\ning. When with a start he lifted his head again and looked \\nround, he forgot at once what he had just been thinking \\nabout and even where he was going. In this way he walked \\nright across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came out on to the Lesser \\nNeva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the islands. \\nThe greenness and freshness were at first restful to his wea-\\nry eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that \\nhemmed him in and weighed upon him. Here there were \\nno taverns, no stifling closeness, no stench. But soon these \\nnew pleasant sensations passed into morbid irritability. \\nSometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer \\nvilla standing among green foliage, he gazed through the \\nfence, he saw in the distance smartly dressed women on the \\nverandahs and balconies, and children running in the gar-\\ndens. The flowers especially caught his attention; he gazed \\n\\uf64b\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nat them longer than at anything. He was met, too, by luxu-\\nrious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he \\nwatched them with curious eyes and forgot about them be-\\nfore they had vanished from his sight. Once he stood still \\nand counted his money; he found he had thirty copecks.',\n",
              " '‘Twenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the letter, so \\nI must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs \\nyesterday,’ he thought, reckoning it up for some unknown \\nreason, but he soon forgot with what object he had taken the \\nmoney out of his pocket. He recalled it on passing an eating-\\nhouse or tavern, and felt that he was hungry…. Going into \\nthe tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a pie of some \\nsort. He finished eating it as he walked away. It was a long \\nwhile since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon \\nhim at once, though he only drank a wineglassful. His legs \\nfelt suddenly heavy and a great drowsiness came upon him. \\nHe turned homewards, but reaching Petrovsky Ostrov he \\nstopped completely exhausted, turned off the road into the \\nbushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep.\\nIn a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a \\nsingular actuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance \\nof reality. At times monstrous images are created, but the \\nsetting and the whole picture are so truthlike and filled \\nwith details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but so artistically \\nconsistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like Push-\\nkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in \\nthe waking state. Such sick dreams always remain long in \\nthe memory and make a powerful impression on the over-\\nwrought and deranged nervous system.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64b\\uf647\\nRaskolnikov had a fearful dream. He dreamt he was back \\nin his childhood in the little town of his birth. He was a \\nchild about seven years old, walking into the country with \\nhis father on the evening of a holiday. It was a grey and \\nheavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it; in-\\ndeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he \\nhad done in memory. The little town stood on a level flat \\nas bare as the hand, not even a willow near it; only in the \\nfar distance, a copse lay, a dark blur on the very edge of the \\nhorizon. A few paces beyond the last market garden stood \\na tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a \\nfeeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with \\nhis father. There was always a crowd there, always shouting, \\nlaughter and abuse, hideous hoarse singing and often fight-\\ning. Drunken and horrible-looking figures were hanging \\nabout the tavern. He used to cling close to his father, trem-\\nbling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the road \\nbecame a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. \\nIt was a winding road, and about a hundred paces further \\non, it turned to the right to the graveyard. In the middle \\nof the graveyard stood a stone church with a green cupola \\nwhere he used to go to mass two or three times a year with \\nhis father and mother, when a service was held in memory \\nof his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom \\nhe had never seen. On these occasions they used to take on \\na white dish tied up in a table napkin a special sort of rice \\npudding with raisins stuck in it in the shape of a cross. He \\nloved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned ikons and \\nthe old priest with the shaking head. Near his grandmoth-\\n\\uf64b\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ner’s grave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave \\nof his younger brother who had died at six months old. He \\ndid not remember him at all, but he had been told about \\nhis little brother, and whenever he visited the graveyard he \\nused religiously and reverently to cross himself and to bow \\ndown and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he \\nwas walking with his father past the tavern on the way to \\nthe graveyard; he was holding his father’s hand and looking \\nwith dread at the tavern. A peculiar circumstance attract-\\ned his attention: there seemed to be some kind of festivity \\ngoing on, there were crowds of gaily dressed townspeople, \\npeasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts, all \\nsinging and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the \\ntavern stood a cart, but a strange cart. It was one of those \\nbig carts usually drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with \\ncasks of wine or other heavy goods. He always liked look-\\ning at those great cart- horses, with their long manes, thick \\nlegs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect mountain \\nwith no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going \\nwith a load than without it. But now, strange to say, in the \\nshafts of such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of \\nthose peasants’ nags which he had often seen straining their \\nutmost under a heavy load of wood or hay, especially when \\nthe wheels were stuck in the mud or in a rut. And the peas-\\nants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even about the \\nnose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that \\nhe almost cried, and his mother always used to take him \\naway from the window. All of a sudden there was a great \\nuproar of shouting, singing and the balalaïka, and from the \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64b\\uf649\\ntavern a number of big and very drunken peasants came \\nout, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over their \\nshoulders.\\n‘Get in, get in!’ shouted one of them, a young thick-\\nnecked peasant with a fleshy face red as a carrot. ‘I’ll take \\nyou all, get in!’\\nBut at once there was an outbreak of laughter and excla-\\nmations in the crowd.\\n‘Take us all with a beast like that!’\\n‘Why, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in \\nsuch a cart?’\\n‘And this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!’\\n‘Get in, I’ll take you all,’ Mikolka shouted again, leaping \\nfirst into the cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up \\nin front. ‘The bay has gone with Matvey,’ he shouted from \\nthe cart—‘and this brute, mates, is just breaking my heart, I \\nfeel as if I could kill her. She’s just eating her head off.',\n",
              " 'Get in, \\nI tell you! I’ll make her gallop! She’ll gallop!’ and he picked \\nup the whip, preparing himself with relish to flog the little \\nmare.\\n‘Get in! Come along!’ The crowd laughed. ‘D’you hear, \\nshe’ll gallop!’\\n‘Gallop indeed! She has not had a gallop in her for the \\nlast ten years!’\\n‘She’ll jog along!’\\n‘Don’t you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get \\nready!’\\n‘All right! Give it to her!’\\nThey all clambered into Mikolka’s cart, laughing and \\n\\uf64b\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nmaking jokes. Six men got in and there was still room for \\nmore. They hauled in a fat, rosy-cheeked woman. She was \\ndressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded headdress and \\nthick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing. The \\ncrowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could \\nthey help laughing? That wretched nag was to drag all the \\ncartload of them at a gallop! Two young fellows in the cart \\nwere just getting whips ready to help Mikolka. With the cry \\nof ‘now,’ the mare tugged with all her might, but far from \\ngalloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled with \\nher legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three \\nwhips which were showered upon her like hail. The laugh-\\nter in the cart and in the crowd was redoubled, but Mikolka \\nflew into a rage and furiously thrashed the mare, as though \\nhe supposed she really could gallop.\\n‘Let me get in, too, mates,’ shouted a young man in the \\ncrowd whose appetite was aroused.\\n‘Get in, all get in,’ cried Mikolka, ‘she will draw you all. \\nI’ll beat her to death!’ And he thrashed and thrashed at the \\nmare, beside himself with fury.\\n‘Father, father,’ he cried, ‘father, what are they doing? Fa-\\nther, they are beating the poor horse!’\\n‘Come along, come along!’ said his father. ‘They are \\ndrunken and foolish, they are in fun; come away, don’t \\nlook!’ and he tried to draw him away, but he tore himself \\naway from his hand, and, beside himself with horror, ran to \\nthe horse. The poor beast was in a bad way. She was gasping, \\nstanding still, then tugging again and almost falling.\\n‘Beat her to death,’ cried Mikolka, ‘it’s come to that. I’ll \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64b\\uf64b\\ndo for her!’\\n‘What are you about, are you a Christian, you devil?’ \\nshouted an old man in the crowd.\\n‘Did anyone ever see the like? A wretched nag like that \\npulling such a cartload,’ said another.\\n‘You’ll kill her,’ shouted the third.\\n‘Don’t meddle! It’s my property, I’ll do what I choose. Get \\nin, more of you! Get in, all of you! I will have her go at a gal-\\nlop! …’\\nAll at once laughter broke into a roar and covered every-\\nthing: the mare, roused by the shower of blows, began feebly \\nkicking. Even the old man could not help smiling. To think \\nof a wretched little beast like that trying to kick!\\nTwo lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the \\nmare to beat her about the ribs. One ran each side.\\n‘Hit her in the face, in the eyes, in the eyes,’ cried Mikol-\\nka.\\n‘Give us a song, mates,’ shouted someone in the cart and \\neveryone in the cart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tam-\\nbourine and whistling. The woman went on cracking nuts \\nand laughing.\\n… He ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her \\nbeing whipped across the eyes, right in the eyes! He was \\ncrying, he felt choking, his tears were streaming. One of the \\nmen gave him a cut with the whip across the face, he did \\nnot feel it. Wringing his hands and screaming, he rushed up \\nto the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who was \\nshaking his head in disapproval. One woman seized him by \\nthe hand and would have taken him away, but he tore him-\\n\\uf64b\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nself from her and ran back to the mare. She was almost at \\nthe last gasp, but began kicking once more.\\n‘I’ll teach you to kick,’ Mikolka shouted ferociously. He \\nthrew down the whip, bent forward and picked up from the \\nbottom of the cart a long, thick shaft, he took hold of one \\nend with both hands and with an effort brandished it over \\nthe mare.\\n‘He’ll crush her,’ was shouted round him. ‘He’ll kill her!’\\n‘It’s my property,’ shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft \\ndown with a swinging blow. There was a sound of a heavy \\nthud.',\n",
              " '‘Thrash her, thrash her! Why have you stopped?’ shouted \\nvoices in the crowd.\\nAnd Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell \\na second time on the spine of the luckless mare. She sank \\nback on her haunches, but lurched forward and tugged for-\\nward with all her force, tugged first on one side and then on \\nthe other, trying to move the cart. But the six whips were at-\\ntacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raised again \\nand fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy \\nmeasured blows. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not \\nkill her at one blow.\\n‘She’s a tough one,’ was shouted in the crowd.\\n‘She’ll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be an end of \\nher,’ said an admiring spectator in the crowd.\\n‘Fetch an axe to her! Finish her off,’ shouted a third.\\n‘I’ll show you! Stand off,’ Mikolka screamed frantical-\\nly; he threw down the shaft, stooped down in the cart and \\npicked up an iron crowbar. ‘Look out,’ he shouted, and with \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64c0\\nall his might he dealt a stunning blow at the poor mare. The \\nblow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull, but \\nthe bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she \\nfell on the ground like a log.\\n‘Finish her off,’ shouted Mikolka and he leapt beside him-\\nself, out of the cart. Several young men, also flushed with \\ndrink, seized anything they could come across—whips, \\nsticks, poles, and ran to the dying mare. Mikolka stood on \\none side and began dealing random blows with the crow-\\nbar. The mare stretched out her head, drew a long breath \\nand died.\\n‘You butchered her,’ someone shouted in the crowd.\\n‘Why wouldn’t she gallop then?’\\n‘My property!’ shouted Mikolka, with bloodshot eyes, \\nbrandishing the bar in his hands. He stood as though re-\\ngretting that he had nothing more to beat.\\n‘No mistake about it, you are not a Christian,’ many voic-\\nes were shouting in the crowd.\\nBut the poor boy, beside himself, made his way, scream-\\ning, through the crowd to the sorrel nag, put his arms round \\nher bleeding dead head and kissed it, kissed the eyes and \\nkissed the lips…. Then he jumped up and flew in a frenzy \\nwith his little fists out at Mikolka. At that instant his father, \\nwho had been running after him, snatched him up and car-\\nried him out of the crowd.\\n‘Come along, come! Let us go home,’ he said to him.\\n‘Father! Why did they … kill … the poor horse!’ he \\nsobbed, but his voice broke and the words came in shrieks \\nfrom his panting chest.\\n\\uf64c1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘They are drunk…. They are brutal … it’s not our busi-\\nness!’ said his father. He put his arms round his father but \\nhe felt choked, choked. He tried to draw a breath, to cry \\nout—and woke up.\\nHe waked up, gasping for breath, his hair soaked with \\nperspiration, and stood up in terror.\\n‘Thank God, that was only a dream,’ he said, sitting down \\nunder a tree and drawing deep breaths. ‘But what is it? Is it \\nsome fever coming on? Such a hideous dream!’\\nHe felt utterly broken: darkness and confusion were in \\nhis soul. He rested his elbows on his knees and leaned his \\nhead on his hands.\\n‘Good God!’ he cried, ‘can it be, can it be, that I shall re-\\nally take an axe, that I shall strike her on the head, split her \\nskull open … that I shall tread in the sticky warm blood, \\nbreak the lock, steal and tremble; hide, all spattered in the \\nblood … with the axe…. Good God, can it be?’\\nHe was shaking like a leaf as he said this.\\n‘But why am I going on like this?’ he continued, sitting \\nup again, as it were in profound amazement. ‘I knew that I \\ncould never bring myself to it, so what have I been tortur-\\ning myself for till now? Yesterday, yesterday, when I went \\nto make that … experiment yesterday I realised complete-\\nly that I could never bear to do it…. Why am I going over \\nit again, then? Why am I hesitating? As I came down the \\nstairs yesterday, I said myself that it was base, loathsome, \\nvile, vile … the very thought of it made me feel sick and \\nfilled me with horror.\\n‘No, I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it! Granted, granted that \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64c\\uf645\\nthere is no flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have con-\\ncluded this last month is clear as day, true as arithmetic…. \\nMy God! Anyway I couldn’t bring myself to it! I couldn’t do \\nit, I couldn’t do it! Why, why then am I still … ?’\\nHe rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though \\nsurprised at finding himself in this place, and went towards \\nthe bridge.',\n",
              " 'He was pale, his eyes glowed, he was exhausted \\nin every limb, but he seemed suddenly to breathe more easi-\\nly. He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that had so long \\nbeen weighing upon him, and all at once there was a sense \\nof relief and peace in his soul. ‘Lord,’ he prayed, ‘show me \\nmy path—I renounce that accursed … dream of mine.’\\nCrossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the \\nNeva, at the glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky. In \\nspite of his weakness he was not conscious of fatigue. It was \\nas though an abscess that had been forming for a month \\npast in his heart had suddenly broken. Freedom, freedom! \\nHe was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession!\\nLater on, when he recalled that time and all that hap-\\npened to him during those days, minute by minute, point \\nby point, he was superstitiously impressed by one circum-\\nstance, which, though in itself not very exceptional, always \\nseemed to him afterwards the predestined turning-point of \\nhis fate. He could never understand and explain to himself \\nwhy, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have \\nbeen more convenient for him to go home by the shortest \\nand most direct way, he had returned by the Hay Market \\nwhere he had no need to go. It was obviously and quite un-\\nnecessarily out of his way, though not much so. It is true that \\n\\uf64c\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nit happened to him dozens of times to return home without \\nnoticing what streets he passed through. But why, he was \\nalways asking himself, why had such an important, such \\na decisive and at the same time such an absolutely chance \\nmeeting happened in the Hay Market (where he had more-\\nover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of \\nhis life when he was just in the very mood and in the very \\ncircumstances in which that meeting was able to exert the \\ngravest and most decisive influence on his whole destiny? \\nAs though it had been lying in wait for him on purpose!\\nIt was about nine o’clock when he crossed the Hay Mar-\\nket. At the tables and the barrows, at the booths and the \\nshops, all the market people were closing their establish-\\nments or clearing away and packing up their wares and, like \\ntheir customers, were going home. Rag pickers and coster-\\nmongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in \\nthe dirty and stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Ras-\\nkolnikov particularly liked this place and the neighbouring \\nalleys, when he wandered aimlessly in the streets. Here his \\nrags did not attract contemptuous attention, and one could \\nwalk about in any attire without scandalising people. At the \\ncorner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables \\nset out with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. They, \\ntoo, had got up to go home, but were lingering in conver-\\nsation with a friend, who had just come up to them. This \\nfriend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyone called her, \\nLizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona \\nIvanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day \\nto pawn his watch and make his experiment…. He already \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64c\\uf647\\nknew all about Lizaveta and she knew him a little too. She \\nwas a single woman of about thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, \\nsubmissive and almost idiotic. She was a complete slave and \\nwent in fear and trembling of her sister, who made her work \\nday and night, and even beat her. She was standing with a \\nbundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly \\nand doubtfully. They were talking of something with spe-\\ncial warmth. The moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, \\nhe was overcome by a strange sensation as it were of intense \\nastonishment, though there was nothing astonishing about \\nthis meeting.\\n‘You could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta \\nIvanovna,’ the huckster was saying aloud. ‘Come round to-\\nmorrow about seven. They will be here too.’\\n‘To-morrow?’ said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as \\nthough unable to make up her mind.\\n‘Upon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Iva-\\nnovna,’ gabbled the huckster’s wife, a lively little woman. ‘I \\nlook at you, you are like some little babe. And she is not \\nyour own sister either-nothing but a step-sister and what a \\nhand she keeps over you!’\\n‘But this time don’t say a word to Alyona Ivanovna,’ her \\nhusband interrupted; ‘that’s my advice, but come round to \\nus without asking. It will be worth your while. Later on your \\nsister herself may have a notion.’\\n‘Am I to come?’\\n‘About seven o’clock to-morrow. And they will be here. \\nYou will be able to decide for yourself.’\\n‘And we’ll have a cup of tea,’ added his wife.\\n\\uf64c\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘All right, I’ll come,’ said Lizaveta, still pondering, and \\nshe began slowly moving away.',\n",
              " 'Raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more. He \\npassed softly, unnoticed, trying not to miss a word. His \\nfirst amazement was followed by a thrill of horror, like a \\nshiver running down his spine. He had learnt, he had sud-\\ndenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day at seven \\no’clock Lizaveta, the old woman’s sister and only compan-\\nion, would be away from home and that therefore at seven \\no’clock precisely the old woman would be left alone.\\nHe was only a few steps from his lodging. He went in like \\na man condemned to death. He thought of nothing and was \\nincapable of thinking; but he felt suddenly in his whole be-\\ning that he had no more freedom of thought, no will, and \\nthat everything was suddenly and irrevocably decided.\\nCertainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable \\nopportunity, he could not reckon on a more certain step \\ntowards the success of the plan than that which had just \\npresented itself. In any case, it would have been difficult to \\nfind out beforehand and with certainty, with greater exact-\\nness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries and \\ninvestigations, that next day at a certain time an old wom-\\nan, on whose life an attempt was contemplated, would be at \\nhome and entirely alone.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64c\\uf649\\nChapter VI\\nL\\nater on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huck-\\nster and his wife had invited Lizaveta. It was a very \\nordinary matter and there was nothing exceptional about \\nit. A family who had come to the town and been reduced to \\npoverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all \\nwomen’s things. As the things would have fetched little in \\nthe market, they were looking for a dealer. This was Lizave-\\nta’s business. She undertook such jobs and was frequently \\nemployed, as she was very honest and always fixed a fair \\nprice and stuck to it. She spoke as a rule little and, as we \\nhave said already, she was very submissive and timid.\\nBut Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The \\ntraces of superstition remained in him long after, and were \\nalmost ineradicable. And in all this he was always after-\\nwards disposed to see something strange and mysterious, \\nas it were, the presence of some peculiar influences and co-\\nincidences. In the previous winter a student he knew called \\nPokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conver-\\nsation to give him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old \\npawnbroker, in case he might want to pawn anything. For \\na long while he did not go to her, for he had lessons and \\nmanaged to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he had re-\\nmembered the address; he had two articles that could be \\npawned: his father’s old silver watch and a little gold ring \\n\\uf64c\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nwith three red stones, a present from his sister at parting. \\nHe decided to take the ring. When he found the old woman \\nhe had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her at the first \\nglance, though he knew nothing special about her. He got \\ntwo roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern \\non his way home. He asked for tea, sat down and sank into \\ndeep thought. A strange idea was pecking at his brain like a \\nchicken in the egg, and very, very much absorbed him.\\nAlmost beside him at the next table there was sitting a \\nstudent, whom he did not know and had never seen, and \\nwith him a young officer. They had played a game of bil-\\nliards and began drinking tea. All at once he heard the \\nstudent mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona \\nIvanovna and give him her address. This of itself seemed \\nstrange to Raskolnikov; he had just come from her and here \\nat once he heard her name. Of course it was a chance, but \\nhe could not shake off a very extraordinary impression, and \\nhere someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him; the \\nstudent began telling his friend various details about Aly-\\nona Ivanovna.\\n‘She is first-rate,’ he said. ‘You can always get money from \\nher. She is as rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand \\nroubles at a time and she is not above taking a pledge for a \\nrouble. Lots of our fellows have had dealings with her. But \\nshe is an awful old harpy….’\\nAnd he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she \\nwas, how if you were only a day late with your interest the \\npledge was lost; how she gave a quarter of the value of an ar-\\nticle and took five and even seven percent a month on it and \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64c\\uf64b\\nso on. The student chattered on, saying that she had a sister \\nLizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was continually \\nbeating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child, \\nthough Lizaveta was at least six feet high.',\n",
              " '‘There’s a phenomenon for you,’ cried the student and he \\nlaughed.\\nThey began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke \\nabout her with a peculiar relish and was continually laugh-\\ning and the officer listened with great interest and asked \\nhim to send Lizaveta to do some mending for him. Raskol-\\nnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about \\nher. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her \\nhalf-sister, being the child of a different mother. She was \\nthirty-five. She worked day and night for her sister, and \\nbesides doing the cooking and the washing, she did sew-\\ning and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister all she \\nearned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any \\nkind without her sister’s permission. The old woman had \\nalready made her will, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this \\nwill she would not get a farthing; nothing but the movables, \\nchairs and so on; all the money was left to a monastery in \\nthe province of N——, that prayers might be said for her in \\nperpetuity. Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister, un-\\nmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably \\ntall with long feet that looked as if they were bent outwards. \\nShe always wore battered goatskin shoes, and was clean in \\nher person. What the student expressed most surprise and \\namusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was continu-\\nally with child.\\n\\uf64c\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘But you say she is hideous?’ observed the officer.\\n‘Yes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier \\ndressed up, but you know she is not at all hideous. She has \\nsuch a good-natured face and eyes. Strikingly so. And the \\nproof of it is that lots of people are attracted by her. She is \\nsuch a soft, gentle creature, ready to put up with anything, \\nalways willing, willing to do anything. And her smile is re-\\nally very sweet.’\\n‘You seem to find her attractive yourself,’ laughed the of-\\nficer.\\n‘From her queerness. No, I’ll tell you what. I could kill \\nthat damned old woman and make off with her money, I as-\\nsure you, without the faintest conscience-prick,’ the student \\nadded with warmth. The officer laughed again while Ras-\\nkolnikov shuddered. How strange it was!\\n‘Listen, I want to ask you a serious question,’ the student \\nsaid hotly. ‘I was joking of course, but look here; on one side \\nwe have a stupid, senseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, hor-\\nrid old woman, not simply useless but doing actual mischief, \\nwho has not an idea what she is living for herself, and who \\nwill die in a day or two in any case. You understand? You \\nunderstand?’\\n‘Yes, yes, I understand,’ answered the officer, watching \\nhis excited companion attentively.\\n‘Well, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives \\nthrown away for want of help and by thousands, on every \\nside! A hundred thousand good deeds could be done and \\nhelped, on that old woman’s money which will be buried in \\na monastery! Hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set \\nCrime and Punishment\\n100\\non the right path; dozens of families saved from destitu-\\ntion, from ruin, from vice, from the Lock hospitals—and \\nall with her money. Kill her, take her money and with the \\nhelp of it devote oneself to the service of humanity and the \\ngood of all. What do you think, would not one tiny crime \\nbe wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life \\nthousands would be saved from corruption and decay. One \\ndeath, and a hundred lives in exchange—it’s simple arith-\\nmetic! Besides, what value has the life of that sickly, stupid, \\nill-natured old woman in the balance of existence! No more \\nthan the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact because \\nthe old woman is doing harm. She is wearing out the lives \\nof others; the other day she bit Lizaveta’s finger out of spite; \\nit almost had to be amputated.’\\n‘Of course she does not deserve to live,’ remarked the of-\\nficer, ‘but there it is, it’s nature.’\\n‘Oh, well, brother, but we have to correct and direct na-\\nture, and, but for that, we should drown in an ocean of \\nprejudice. But for that, there would never have been a single \\ngreat man. They talk of duty, conscience—I don’t want to \\nsay anything against duty and conscience; —but the point \\nis, what do we mean by them. Stay, I have another question \\nto ask you. Listen!’\\n‘No, you stay, I’ll ask you a question.',\n",
              " 'Listen!’\\n‘Well?’\\n‘You are talking and speechifying away, but tell me, \\nwould you kill the old woman yourself?’\\n‘Of course not! I was only arguing the justice of it…. It’s \\nnothing to do with me….’\\n101\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘But I think, if you would not do it yourself, there’s no \\njustice about it…. Let us have another game.’\\nRaskolnikov was violently agitated. Of course, it was all \\nordinary youthful talk and thought, such as he had often \\nheard before in different forms and on different themes. But \\nwhy had he happened to hear such a discussion and such \\nideas at the very moment when his own brain was just con-\\nceiving … the very same ideas? And why, just at the moment \\nwhen he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the \\nold woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation \\nabout her? This coincidence always seemed strange to him. \\nThis trivial talk in a tavern had an immense influence on \\nhim in his later action; as though there had really been in it \\nsomething preordained, some guiding hint….\\n*****\\nOn returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on \\nthe sofa and sat for a whole hour without stirring. Mean-\\nwhile it got dark; he had no candle and, indeed, it did not \\noccur to him to light up. He could never recollect whether \\nhe had been thinking about anything at that time. At last \\nhe was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he \\nrealised with relief that he could lie down on the sofa. Soon \\nheavy, leaden sleep came over him, as it were crushing him.\\nHe slept an extraordinarily long time and without dream-\\ning. Nastasya, coming into his room at ten o’clock the next \\nmorning, had difficulty in rousing him. She brought him in \\ntea and bread. The tea was again the second brew and again \\nin her own tea-pot.\\n‘My goodness, how he sleeps!’ she cried indignantly. ‘And \\nCrime and Punishment\\n10\\uf645\\nhe is always asleep.’\\nHe got up with an effort. His head ached, he stood up, \\ntook a turn in his garret and sank back on the sofa again.\\n‘Going to sleep again,’ cried Nastasya. ‘Are you ill, eh?’\\nHe made no reply.\\n‘Do you want some tea?’\\n‘Afterwards,’ he said with an effort, closing his eyes again \\nand turning to the wall.\\nNastasya stood over him.\\n‘Perhaps he really is ill,’ she said, turned and went out. \\nShe came in again at two o’clock with soup. He was lying as \\nbefore. The tea stood untouched. Nastasya felt positively of-\\nfended and began wrathfully rousing him.\\n‘Why are you lying like a log?’ she shouted, looking at \\nhim with repulsion.\\nHe got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and \\nstared at the floor.\\n‘Are you ill or not?’ asked Nastasya and again received no \\nanswer. ‘You’d better go out and get a breath of air,’ she said \\nafter a pause. ‘Will you eat it or not?’\\n‘Afterwards,’ he said weakly. ‘You can go.’\\nAnd he motioned her out.\\nShe remained a little longer, looked at him with compas-\\nsion and went out.\\nA few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked \\nfor a long while at the tea and the soup.',\n",
              " 'Then he took the \\nbread, took up a spoon and began to eat.\\nHe ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, \\nas it were mechanically. His head ached less. After his meal \\n10\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nhe stretched himself on the sofa again, but now he could not \\nsleep; he lay without stirring, with his face in the pillow. He \\nwas haunted by day-dreams and such strange day-dreams; \\nin one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was in Afri-\\nca, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting, \\nthe camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood \\nall around in a complete circle; all the party were at din-\\nner. But he was drinking water from a spring which flowed \\ngurgling close by. And it was so cool, it was wonderful, \\nwonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-co-\\nloured stones and over the clean sand which glistened here \\nand there like gold…. Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He \\nstarted, roused himself, raised his head, looked out of the \\nwindow, and seeing how late it was, suddenly jumped up \\nwide awake as though someone had pulled him off the sofa. \\nHe crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and be-\\ngan listening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But \\nall was quiet on the stairs as if everyone was asleep…. It \\nseemed to him strange and monstrous that he could have \\nslept in such forgetfulness from the previous day and had \\ndone nothing, had prepared nothing yet…. And meanwhile \\nperhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupe-\\nfaction were followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it \\nwere distracted haste. But the preparations to be made were \\nfew. He concentrated all his energies on thinking of every-\\nthing and forgetting nothing; and his heart kept beating \\nand thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he had \\nto make a noose and sew it into his overcoat—a work of a \\nmoment. He rummaged under his pillow and picked out \\nCrime and Punishment\\n10\\uf647\\namongst the linen stuffed away under it, a worn out, old \\nunwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a long strip, a cou-\\nple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He folded \\nthis strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat \\nof some stout cotton material (his only outer garment) and \\nbegan sewing the two ends of the rag on the inside, under \\nthe left armhole. His hands shook as he sewed, but he did \\nit successfully so that nothing showed outside when he put \\nthe coat on again. The needle and thread he had got ready \\nlong before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As \\nfor the noose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the \\nnoose was intended for the axe. It was impossible for him to \\ncarry the axe through the street in his hands. And if hidden \\nunder his coat he would still have had to support it with his \\nhand, which would have been noticeable. Now he had only \\nto put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang \\nquietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his \\ncoat pocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, \\nso that it did not swing; and as the coat was very full, a regu-\\nlar sack in fact, it could not be seen from outside that he was \\nholding something with the hand that was in the pocket. \\nThis noose, too, he had designed a fortnight before.\\nWhen he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a \\nlittle opening between his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the \\nleft corner and drew out the pledge which he had got ready \\nlong before and hidden there. This pledge was, however, \\nonly a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and thick-\\nness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of \\nwood in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there \\n10\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nwas some sort of a workshop. Afterwards he had added to \\nthe wood a thin smooth piece of iron, which he had also \\npicked up at the same time in the street. Putting the iron \\nwhich was a little the smaller on the piece of wood, he fas-\\ntened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread \\nround them; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in \\nclean white paper and tied up the parcel so that it would be \\nvery difficult to untie it. This was in order to divert the at-\\ntention of the old woman for a time, while she was trying to \\nundo the knot, and so to gain a moment. The iron strip was \\nadded to give weight, so that the woman might not guess \\nthe first minute that the ‘thing’ was made of wood. All this \\nhad been stored by him beforehand under the sofa.',\n",
              " 'He had \\nonly just got the pledge out when he heard someone sud-\\ndenly about in the yard.\\n‘It struck six long ago.’\\n‘Long ago! My God!’\\nHe rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and \\nbegan to descend his thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, \\nlike a cat. He had still the most important thing to do—to \\nsteal the axe from the kitchen. That the deed must be done \\nwith an axe he had decided long ago. He had also a pocket \\npruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still \\nless on his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe. \\nWe may note in passing, one peculiarity in regard to all the \\nfinal resolutions taken by him in the matter; they had one \\nstrange characteristic: the more final they were, the more \\nhideous and the more absurd they at once became in his \\neyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never \\nCrime and Punishment\\n10\\uf649\\nfor a single instant all that time could believe in the carry-\\ning out of his plans.\\nAnd, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything \\nto the least point could have been considered and finally \\nsettled, and no uncertainty of any kind had remained, he \\nwould, it seems, have renounced it all as something absurd, \\nmonstrous and impossible. But a whole mass of unsettled \\npoints and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe, \\nthat trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could \\nbe easier. Nastasya was continually out of the house, espe-\\ncially in the evenings; she would run in to the neighbours or \\nto a shop, and always left the door ajar. It was the one thing \\nthe landlady was always scolding her about. And so, when \\nthe time came, he would only have to go quietly into the \\nkitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when every-\\nthing was over) go in and put it back again. But these were \\ndoubtful points. Supposing he returned an hour later to put \\nit back, and Nastasya had come back and was on the spot. \\nHe would of course have to go by and wait till she went out \\nagain. But supposing she were in the meantime to miss the \\naxe, look for it, make an outcry —that would mean suspi-\\ncion or at least grounds for suspicion.\\nBut those were all trifles which he had not even begun \\nto consider, and indeed he had no time. He was thinking \\nof the chief point, and put off trifling details, until he could \\nbelieve in it all. But that seemed utterly unattainable. So it \\nseemed to himself at least. He could not imagine, for in-\\nstance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get up \\nand simply go there…. Even his late experiment (i.e. his vis-\\n10\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nit with the object of a final survey of the place) was simply \\nan attempt at an experiment, far from being the real thing, \\nas though one should say ‘come, let us go and try it—why \\ndream about it!’—and at once he had broken down and had \\nrun away cursing, in a frenzy with himself. Meanwhile it \\nwould seem, as regards the moral question, that his analy-\\nsis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, \\nand he could not find rational objections in himself. But \\nin the last resort he simply ceased to believe in himself, \\nand doggedly, slavishly sought arguments in all directions, \\nfumbling for them, as though someone were forcing and \\ndrawing him to it.\\nAt first—long before indeed—he had been much occu-\\npied with one question; why almost all crimes are so badly \\nconcealed and so easily detected, and why almost all crimi-\\nnals leave such obvious traces? He had come gradually to \\nmany different and curious conclusions, and in his opinion \\nthe chief reason lay not so much in the material impossi-\\nbility of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. \\nAlmost every criminal is subject to a failure of will and rea-\\nsoning power by a childish and phenomenal heedlessness, \\nat the very instant when prudence and caution are most es-\\nsential. It was his conviction that this eclipse of reason and \\nfailure of will power attacked a man like a disease, devel-\\noped gradually and reached its highest point just before the \\nperpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence \\nat the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time \\nafter, according to the individual case, and then passed off \\nlike any other disease. The question whether the disease \\nCrime and Punishment\\n10\\uf64b\\ngives rise to the crime, or whether the crime from its own \\npeculiar nature is always accompanied by something of the \\nnature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.\\nWhen he reached these conclusions, he decided that in \\nhis own case there could not be such a morbid reaction, that \\nhis reason and will would remain unimpaired at the time of \\ncarrying out his design, for the simple reason that his design \\nwas ‘not a crime….’ We will omit all the process by means of \\nwhich he arrived at this last conclusion; we have run too far \\nahead already…. We may add only that the practical, purely \\nmaterial difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary posi-\\ntion in his mind. ‘One has but to keep all one’s will-power \\nand reason to deal with them, and they will all be overcome \\nat the time when once one has familiarised oneself with the \\nminutest details of the business….’ But this preparation had \\nnever been begun. His final decisions were what he came \\nto trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass \\nquite differently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.\\nOne trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before \\nhe had even left the staircase.',\n",
              " 'When he reached the land-\\nlady’s kitchen, the door of which was open as usual, he \\nglanced cautiously in to see whether, in Nastasya’s absence, \\nthe landlady herself was there, or if not, whether the door \\nto her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out \\nwhen he went in for the axe. But what was his amazement \\nwhen he suddenly saw that Nastasya was not only at home \\nin the kitchen, but was occupied there, taking linen out of \\na basket and hanging it on a line. Seeing him, she left off \\nhanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him all the \\n10\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ntime he was passing. He turned away his eyes, and walked \\npast as though he noticed nothing. But it was the end of ev-\\nerything; he had not the axe! He was overwhelmed.\\n‘What made me think,’ he reflected, as he went under the \\ngateway, ‘what made me think that she would be sure not \\nto be at home at that moment! Why, why, why did I assume \\nthis so certainly?’\\nHe was crushed and even humiliated. He could have \\nlaughed at himself in his anger…. A dull animal rage boiled \\nwithin him.\\nHe stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street, \\nto go a walk for appearance’ sake was revolting; to go back \\nto his room, even more revolting. ‘And what a chance I have \\nlost for ever!’ he muttered, standing aimlessly in the gate-\\nway, just opposite the porter’s little dark room, which was \\nalso open. Suddenly he started. From the porter’s room, two \\npaces away from him, something shining under the bench \\nto the right caught his eye…. He looked about him—no-\\nbody. He approached the room on tiptoe, went down two \\nsteps into it and in a faint voice called the porter. ‘Yes, not at \\nhome! Somewhere near though, in the yard, for the door is \\nwide open.’ He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled it \\nout from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks \\nof wood; at once, before going out, he made it fast in the \\nnoose, he thrust both hands into his pockets and went out \\nof the room; no one had noticed him! ‘When reason fails, \\nthe devil helps!’ he thought with a strange grin. This chance \\nraised his spirits extraordinarily.\\nHe walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to \\nCrime and Punishment\\n110\\navoid awakening suspicion. He scarcely looked at the pass-\\ners-by, tried to escape looking at their faces at all, and to be \\nas little noticeable as possible. Suddenly he thought of his \\nhat. ‘Good heavens! I had the money the day before yester-\\nday and did not get a cap to wear instead!’ A curse rose from \\nthe bottom of his soul.\\nGlancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw \\nby a clock on the wall that it was ten minutes past seven. \\nHe had to make haste and at the same time to go someway \\nround, so as to approach the house from the other side….\\nWhen he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, \\nhe had sometimes thought that he would be very much \\nafraid. But he was not very much afraid now, was not afraid \\nat all, indeed. His mind was even occupied by irrelevant \\nmatters, but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupov \\ngarden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the build-\\ning of great fountains, and of their refreshing effect on the \\natmosphere in all the squares. By degrees he passed to the \\nconviction that if the summer garden were extended to the \\nfield of Mars, and perhaps joined to the garden of the Mi-\\nhailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a great \\nbenefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question \\nwhy in all great towns men are not simply driven by ne-\\ncessity, but in some peculiar way inclined to live in those \\nparts of the town where there are no gardens nor fountains; \\nwhere there is most dirt and smell and all sorts of nastiness. \\nThen his own walks through the Hay Market came back to \\nhis mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality. ‘What \\nnonsense!’ he thought, ‘better think of nothing at all!’\\n111\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at ev-\\nery object that meets them on the way,’ flashed through his \\nmind, but simply flashed, like lightning; he made haste to \\ndismiss this thought…. And by now he was near; here was \\nthe house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clock somewhere \\nstruck once. ‘What! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, it \\nmust be fast!’\\nLuckily for him, everything went well again at the gates. \\nAt that very moment, as though expressly for his benefit, \\na huge waggon of hay had just driven in at the gate, com-\\npletely screening him as he passed under the gateway, and \\nthe waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into the \\nyard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the \\nother side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quar-\\nrelling; but no one noticed him and no one met him. Many \\nwindows looking into that huge quadrangular yard were \\nopen at that moment, but he did not raise his head—he had \\nnot the strength to.',\n",
              " 'The staircase leading to the old woman’s \\nroom was close by, just on the right of the gateway. He was \\nalready on the stairs….\\nDrawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throb-\\nbing heart, and once more feeling for the axe and setting it \\nstraight, he began softly and cautiously ascending the stairs, \\nlistening every minute. But the stairs, too, were quite desert-\\ned; all the doors were shut; he met no one. One flat indeed \\non the first floor was wide open and painters were at work \\nin it, but they did not glance at him.

What is it?’ she \\nasked, looking at the pledge.\\n‘The silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time, you \\nknow.’\\nShe held out her hand.\\n‘But how pale you are, to be sure … and your hands are \\ntrembling too? Have you been bathing, or what?’\\n‘Fever,’ he answered abruptly. ‘You can’t help getting pale \\n… if you’ve nothing to eat,’ he added, with difficulty articu-\\nlating the words.\\nHis strength was failing him again. But his answer \\nCrime and Punishment\\n11\\uf649\\nsounded like the truth; the old woman took the pledge.\\n‘What is it?’ she asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov \\nintently, and weighing the pledge in her hand.\\n‘A thing … cigarette case…. Silver…. Look at it.’\\n‘It does not seem somehow like silver…. How he has \\nwrapped it up!’\\nTrying to untie the string and turning to the window, \\nto the light (all her windows were shut, in spite of the sti-\\nfling heat), she left him altogether for some seconds and \\nstood with her back to him. He unbuttoned his coat and \\nfreed the axe from the noose, but did not yet take it out al-\\ntogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the coat. \\nHis hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment \\ngrowing more numb and more wooden. He was afraid he \\nwould let the axe slip and fall…. A sudden giddiness came \\nover him.\\n‘But what has he tied it up like this for?’ the old woman \\ncried with vexation and moved towards him.\\nHe had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe \\nquite out, swung it with both arms, scarcely conscious of \\nhimself, and almost without effort, almost mechanically, \\nbrought the blunt side down on her head. He seemed not \\nto use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had once \\nbrought the axe down, his strength returned to him.\\nThe old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light \\nhair, streaked with grey, thickly smeared with grease, was \\nplaited in a rat’s tail and fastened by a broken horn comb \\nwhich stood out on the nape of her neck. As she was so short, \\nthe blow fell on the very top of her skull. She cried out, but \\n11\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nvery faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the floor, \\nraising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held ‘the \\npledge.’ Then he dealt her another and another blow with \\nthe blunt side and on the same spot. The blood gushed as \\nfrom an overturned glass, the body fell back. He stepped \\nback, let it fall, and at once bent over her face; she was dead. \\nHer eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets, the brow \\nand the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.',\n",
              " 'He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and \\nfelt at once in her pocket (trying to avoid the streaming \\nbody)—the same right-hand pocket from which she had \\ntaken the key on his last visit. He was in full possession \\nof his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his \\nhands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that \\nhe had been particularly collected and careful, trying all \\nthe time not to get smeared with blood…. He pulled out \\nthe keys at once, they were all, as before, in one bunch on \\na steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom with them. It \\nwas a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images. \\nAgainst the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and cov-\\nered with a silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third \\nwall was a chest of drawers. Strange to say, so soon as he \\nbegan to fit the keys into the chest, so soon as he heard their \\njingling, a convulsive shudder passed over him. He sud-\\ndenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go away. But \\nthat was only for an instant; it was too late to go back. He \\npositively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terri-\\nfying idea occurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that \\nthe old woman might be still alive and might recover her \\nCrime and Punishment\\n11\\uf64b\\nsenses. Leaving the keys in the chest, he ran back to the \\nbody, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more over the \\nold woman, but did not bring it down. There was no doubt \\nthat she was dead. Bending down and examining her again \\nmore closely, he saw clearly that the skull was broken and \\neven battered in on one side. He was about to feel it with \\nhis finger, but drew back his hand and indeed it was evident \\nwithout that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of blood. \\nAll at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at \\nit, but the string was strong and did not snap and besides, \\nit was soaked with blood. He tried to pull it out from the \\nfront of the dress, but something held it and prevented its \\ncoming. In his impatience he raised the axe again to cut the \\nstring from above on the body, but did not dare, and with \\ndifficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood, af-\\nter two minutes’ hurried effort, he cut the string and took \\nit off without touching the body with the axe; he was not \\nmistaken—it was a purse. On the string were two crosses, \\none of Cyprus wood and one of copper, and an image in sil-\\nver filigree, and with them a small greasy chamois leather \\npurse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffed very \\nfull; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at \\nit, flung the crosses on the old woman’s body and rushed \\nback into the bedroom, this time taking the axe with him.\\nHe was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began \\ntrying them again. But he was unsuccessful. They would \\nnot fit in the locks. It was not so much that his hands were \\nshaking, but that he kept making mistakes; though he saw \\nfor instance that a key was not the right one and would not \\n11\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nfit, still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he remembered and \\nrealised that the big key with the deep notches, which was \\nhanging there with the small keys could not possibly be-\\nlong to the chest of drawers (on his last visit this had struck \\nhim), but to some strong box, and that everything perhaps \\nwas hidden in that box. He left the chest of drawers, and at \\nonce felt under the bedstead, knowing that old women usu-\\nally keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was a \\ngood-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with \\nan arched lid covered with red leather and studded with \\nsteel nails. The notched key fitted at once and unlocked \\nit. At the top, under a white sheet, was a coat of red bro-\\ncade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress, then a \\nshawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but \\nclothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood- stained \\nhands on the red brocade. ‘It’s red, and on red blood will be \\nless noticeable,’ the thought passed through his mind; then \\nhe suddenly came to himself. ‘Good God, am I going out of \\nmy senses?’ he thought with terror.\\nBut no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold \\nwatch slipped from under the fur coat. He made haste to \\nturn them all over. There turned out to be various articles \\nmade of gold among the clothes—probably all pledges, un-\\nredeemed or waiting to be redeemed—bracelets, chains, \\near-rings, pins and such things. Some were in cases, others \\nsimply wrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly fold-\\ned, and tied round with tape.',\n",
              " 'Without any delay, he began \\nfilling up the pockets of his trousers and overcoat without \\nexamining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he had not \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf6450\\ntime to take many….\\nHe suddenly heard steps in the room where the old wom-\\nan lay. He stopped short and was still as death. But all was \\nquiet, so it must have been his fancy. All at once he heard \\ndistinctly a faint cry, as though someone had uttered a low \\nbroken moan. Then again dead silence for a minute or two. \\nHe sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited holding \\nhis breath. Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran \\nout of the bedroom.\\nIn the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big \\nbundle in her arms. She was gazing in stupefaction at her \\nmurdered sister, white as a sheet and seeming not to have \\nthe strength to cry out. Seeing him run out of the bedroom, \\nshe began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a shudder \\nran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, \\nbut still did not scream. She began slowly backing away \\nfrom him into the corner, staring intently, persistently at \\nhim, but still uttered no sound, as though she could not get \\nbreath to scream. He rushed at her with the axe; her mouth \\ntwitched piteously, as one sees babies’ mouths, when they \\nbegin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them \\nand are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Liza-\\nveta was so simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and \\nscared that she did not even raise a hand to guard her face, \\nthough that was the most necessary and natural action at \\nthe moment, for the axe was raised over her face. She only \\nput up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly hold-\\ning it out before her as though motioning him away. The \\naxe fell with the sharp edge just on the skull and split at one \\n1\\uf6451\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nblow all the top of the head. She fell heavily at once. Ras-\\nkolnikov completely lost his head, snatching up her bundle, \\ndropped it again and ran into the entry.\\nFear gained more and more mastery over him, especially \\nafter this second, quite unexpected murder. He longed to \\nrun away from the place as fast as possible. And if at that \\nmoment he had been capable of seeing and reasoning more \\ncorrectly, if he had been able to realise all the difficulties \\nof his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the \\nabsurdity of it, if he could have understood how many ob-\\nstacles and, perhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to \\ncommit, to get out of that place and to make his way home, \\nit is very possible that he would have flung up everything, \\nand would have gone to give himself up, and not from fear, \\nbut from simple horror and loathing of what he had done. \\nThe feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and \\ngrew stronger every minute. He would not now have gone \\nto the box or even into the room for anything in the world.\\nBut a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun \\nby degrees to take possession of him; at moments he for-\\ngot himself, or rather, forgot what was of importance, and \\ncaught at trifles. Glancing, however, into the kitchen and \\nseeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought \\nhim of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky \\nwith blood. He dropped the axe with the blade in the water, \\nsnatched a piece of soap that lay in a broken saucer on the \\nwindow, and began washing his hands in the bucket. When \\nthey were clean, he took out the axe, washed the blade and \\nspent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf645\\uf645\\nwhere there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap. \\nThen he wiped it all with some linen that was hanging to \\ndry on a line in the kitchen and then he was a long while \\nattentively examining the axe at the window. There was no \\ntrace left on it, only the wood was still damp. He carefully \\nhung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as \\nwas possible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over \\nhis overcoat, his trousers and his boots. At the first glance \\nthere seemed to be nothing but stains on the boots. He wet-\\nted the rag and rubbed the boots. But he knew he was not \\nlooking thoroughly, that there might be something quite \\nnoticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle \\nof the room, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas rose in \\nhis mind—the idea that he was mad and that at that mo-\\nment he was incapable of reasoning, of protecting himself, \\nthat he ought perhaps to be doing something utterly differ-\\nent from what he was now doing. ‘Good God!’ he muttered \\n‘I must fly, fly,’ and he rushed into the entry. But here a shock \\nof terror awaited him such as he had never known before.',\n",
              " 'He stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the \\ndoor, the outer door from the stairs, at which he had not \\nlong before waited and rung, was standing unfastened and \\nat least six inches open. No lock, no bolt, all the time, all \\nthat time! The old woman had not shut it after him perhaps \\nas a precaution. But, good God! Why, he had seen Lizaveta \\nafterwards! And how could he, how could he have failed to \\nreflect that she must have come in somehow! She could not \\nhave come through the wall!\\nHe dashed to the door and fastened the latch.\\n1\\uf645\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘But no, the wrong thing again! I must get away, get \\naway….’\\nHe unfastened the latch, opened the door and began lis-\\ntening on the staircase.\\nHe listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be \\nin the gateway, two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, \\nquarrelling and scolding. ‘What are they about?’ He waited \\npatiently. At last all was still, as though suddenly cut off; \\nthey had separated. He was meaning to go out, but suddenly, \\non the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone \\nbegan going downstairs humming a tune. ‘How is it they all \\nmake such a noise?’ flashed through his mind. Once more \\nhe closed the door and waited. At last all was still, not a soul \\nstirring. He was just taking a step towards the stairs when \\nhe heard fresh footsteps.\\nThe steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the \\nstairs, but he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that \\nfrom the first sound he began for some reason to suspect \\nthat this was someone coming there to the fourth floor, to \\nthe old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehow peculiar, \\nsignificant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Now \\nhe had passed the first floor, now he was mounting high-\\ner, it was growing more and more distinct! He could hear \\nhis heavy breathing. And now the third storey had been \\nreached. Coming here! And it seemed to him all at once that \\nhe was turned to stone, that it was like a dream in which \\none is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and \\nis rooted to the spot and cannot even move one’s arms.\\nAt last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf645\\uf647\\nfloor, he suddenly started, and succeeded in slipping neatly \\nand quickly back into the flat and closing the door behind \\nhim. Then he took the hook and softly, noiselessly, fixed it \\nin the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had done this, \\nhe crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknown \\nvisitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing \\nopposite one another, as he had just before been standing \\nwith the old woman, when the door divided them and he \\nwas listening.\\nThe visitor panted several times. ‘He must be a big, fat \\nman,’ thought Raskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. \\nIt seemed like a dream indeed. The visitor took hold of the \\nbell and rang it loudly.\\nAs soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to \\nbe aware of something moving in the room. For some sec-\\nonds he listened quite seriously. The unknown rang again, \\nwaited and suddenly tugged violently and impatiently at \\nthe handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror at the \\nhook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected \\nevery minute that the fastening would be pulled out. It cer-\\ntainly did seem possible, so violently was he shaking it. He \\nwas tempted to hold the fastening, but he might be aware \\nof it. A giddiness came over him again. ‘I shall fall down!’ \\nflashed through his mind, but the unknown began to speak \\nand he recovered himself at once.\\n‘What’s up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them!’ \\nhe bawled in a thick voice, ‘Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old \\nwitch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey, my beauty! open the door! \\nOh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?’\\n1\\uf645\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nAnd again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen \\ntimes at the bell.',\n",
              " 'He must certainly be a man of authority \\nand an intimate acquaintance.\\nAt this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, \\non the stairs. someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov \\nhad not heard them at first.\\n‘You don’t say there’s no one at home,’ the new-comer \\ncried in a cheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, \\nwho still went on pulling the bell. ‘Good evening, Koch.’\\n‘From his voice he must be quite young,’ thought Ras-\\nkolnikov.\\n‘Who the devil can tell? I’ve almost broken the lock,’ an-\\nswered Koch. ‘But how do you come to know me?\\n‘Why! The day before yesterday I beat you three times \\nrunning at billiards at Gambrinus’.’\\n‘Oh!’\\n‘So they are not at home? That’s queer. It’s awfully stupid \\nthough. Where could the old woman have gone? I’ve come \\non business.’\\n‘Yes; and I have business with her, too.’\\n‘Well, what can we do? Go back, I suppose, Aie—aie! And \\nI was hoping to get some money!’ cried the young man.\\n‘We must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this \\ntime for? The old witch fixed the time for me to come her-\\nself. It’s out of my way. And where the devil she can have got \\nto, I can’t make out. She sits here from year’s end to year’s \\nend, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet here all of a sudden \\nshe is out for a walk!’\\n‘Hadn’t we better ask the porter?’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf645\\uf649\\n‘What?’\\n‘Where she’s gone and when she’ll be back.’\\n‘Hm…. Damn it all! … We might ask…. But you know \\nshe never does go anywhere.’\\nAnd he once more tugged at the door-handle.\\n‘Damn it all. There’s nothing to be done, we must go!’\\n‘Stay!’ cried the young man suddenly. ‘Do you see how \\nthe door shakes if you pull it?’\\n‘Well?’\\n‘That shows it’s not locked, but fastened with the hook! \\nDo you hear how the hook clanks?’\\n‘Well?’\\n‘Why, don’t you see? That proves that one of them is at \\nhome. If they were all out, they would have locked the door \\nfrom the outside with the key and not with the hook from \\ninside. There, do you hear how the hook is clanking? To \\nfasten the hook on the inside they must be at home, don’t \\nyou see. So there they are sitting inside and don’t open the \\ndoor!’\\n‘Well! And so they must be!’ cried Koch, astonished. \\n‘What are they about in there?’ And he began furiously \\nshaking the door.\\n‘Stay!’ cried the young man again. ‘Don’t pull at it! There \\nmust be something wrong…. Here, you’ve been ringing \\nand pulling at the door and still they don’t open! So either \\nthey’ve both fainted or …’\\n‘What?’\\n‘I tell you what.

              " '’\\n‘I’m studying the law you see! It’s evident, e-vi-dent \\nthere’s something wrong here!’ the young man cried hotly, \\nand he ran downstairs.\\nKoch remained. Once more he softly touched the bell \\nwhich gave one tinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and \\nlooking about him, began touching the door-handle pull-\\ning it and letting it go to make sure once more that it was \\nonly fastened by the hook. Then puffing and panting he bent \\ndown and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in \\nthe lock on the inside and so nothing could be seen.\\nRaskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe. He was \\nin a sort of delirium. He was even making ready to fight \\nwhen they should come in. While they were knocking and \\ntalking together, the idea several times occurred to him to \\nend it all at once and shout to them through the door. Now \\nand then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them, \\nwhile they could not open the door! ‘Only make haste!’ was \\nthe thought that flashed through his mind.\\n‘But what the devil is he about? …’ Time was passing, one \\nminute, and another—no one came. Koch began to be rest-\\nless.\\n‘What the devil?’ he cried suddenly and in impatience \\ndeserting his sentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf645\\uf64b\\nthumping with his heavy boots on the stairs. The steps died \\naway.\\n‘Good heavens! What am I to do?’\\nRaskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door—\\nthere was no sound. Abruptly, without any thought at all, \\nhe went out, closing the door as thoroughly as he could, and \\nwent downstairs.\\nHe had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard \\na loud voice below—where could he go! There was nowhere \\nto hide. He was just going back to the flat.\\n‘Hey there! Catch the brute!’\\nSomebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rath-\\ner fell than ran down the stairs, bawling at the top of his \\nvoice.\\n‘Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him!’\\nThe shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from \\nthe yard; all was still. But at the same instant several men \\ntalking loud and fast began noisily mounting the stairs. \\nThere were three or four of them. He distinguished the ring-\\ning voice of the young man. ‘They!’\\nFilled with despair he went straight to meet them, feel-\\ning ‘come what must!’ If they stopped him—all was lost; if \\nthey let him pass—all was lost too; they would remember \\nhim. They were approaching; they were only a flight from \\nhim—and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on \\nthe right, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, \\nthe flat on the second floor where the painters had been at \\nwork, and which, as though for his benefit, they had just \\nleft. It was they, no doubt, who had just run down, shouting. \\n1\\uf645\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nThe floor had only just been painted, in the middle of the \\nroom stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. \\nIn one instant he had whisked in at the open door and hid-\\nden behind the wall and only in the nick of time; they had \\nalready reached the landing. Then they turned and went on \\nup to the fourth floor, talking loudly. He waited, went out \\non tiptoe and ran down the stairs.\\nNo one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He passed \\nquickly through the gateway and turned to the left in the \\nstreet.\\nHe knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment \\nthey were at the flat, that they were greatly astonished at \\nfinding it unlocked, as the door had just been fastened, that \\nby now they were looking at the bodies, that before another \\nminute had passed they would guess and completely realise \\nthat the murderer had just been there, and had succeeded \\nin hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping. They \\nwould guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, \\nwhile they were going upstairs. And meanwhile he dared \\nnot quicken his pace much, though the next turning was \\nstill nearly a hundred yards away. ‘Should he slip through \\nsome gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? \\nNo, hopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take \\na cab? Hopeless, hopeless!’\\nAt last he reached the turning. He turned down it more \\ndead than alive. Here he was half way to safety, and he un-\\nderstood it; it was less risky because there was a great crowd \\nof people, and he was lost in it like a grain of sand. But all \\nhe had suffered had so weakened him that he could scarcely \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf6460\\nmove. Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all \\nwet.',\n",
              " '‘My word, he has been going it!’ someone shouted at \\nhim when he came out on the canal bank.\\nHe was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the \\nfarther he went the worse it was. He remembered however, \\nthat on coming out on to the canal bank, he was alarmed \\nat finding few people there and so being more conspicuous, \\nand he had thought of turning back. Though he was almost \\nfalling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get \\nhome from quite a different direction.\\nHe was not fully conscious when he passed through the \\ngateway of his house! he was already on the staircase before \\nhe recollected the axe. And yet he had a very grave prob-\\nlem before him, to put it back and to escape observation \\nas far as possible in doing so. He was of course incapable \\nof reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to re-\\nstore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody’s \\nyard. But it all happened fortunately, the door of the por-\\nter’s room was closed but not locked, so that it seemed most \\nlikely that the porter was at home. But he had so completely \\nlost all power of reflection that he walked straight to the \\ndoor and opened it. If the porter had asked him, ‘What do \\nyou want?’ he would perhaps have simply handed him the \\naxe. But again the porter was not at home, and he succeeded \\nin putting the axe back under the bench, and even covering \\nit with the chunk of wood as before.

Past two o’clock!’\\nHe sat down on the sofa—and instantly recollected \\neverything! All at once, in one flash, he recollected every-\\nthing.\\nFor the first moment he thought he was going mad. A \\ndreadful chill came over him; but the chill was from the \\nfever that had begun long before in his sleep. Now he was \\nsuddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his teeth chat-\\ntered and all his limbs were shaking. He opened the door \\nand began listening—everything in the house was asleep. \\nWith amazement he gazed at himself and everything in the \\nroom around him, wondering how he could have come in \\nthe night before without fastening the door, and have flung \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf646\\uf647\\nhimself on the sofa without undressing, without even tak-\\ning his hat off. It had fallen off and was lying on the floor \\nnear his pillow.\\n‘If anyone had come in, what would he have thought? \\nThat I’m drunk but …’\\nHe rushed to the window. There was light enough, and \\nhe began hurriedly looking himself all over from head to \\nfoot, all his clothes; were there no traces? But there was no \\ndoing it like that; shivering with cold, he began taking off \\neverything and looking over again. He turned everything \\nover to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, \\nwent through his search three times.\\nBut there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one \\nplace, where some thick drops of congealed blood were \\nclinging to the frayed edge of his trousers. He picked up a \\nbig claspknife and cut off the frayed threads. There seemed \\nto be nothing more.\\nSuddenly he remembered that the purse and the things \\nhe had taken out of the old woman’s box were still in his \\npockets! He had not thought till then of taking them out \\nand hiding them! He had not even thought of them while he \\nwas examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushed \\nto take them out and fling them on the table. When he had \\npulled out everything, and turned the pocket inside out to \\nbe sure there was nothing left, he carried the whole heap to \\nthe corner.

Mechanical-\\nly he drew from a chair beside him his old student’s winter \\ncoat, which was still warm though almost in rags, covered \\nhimself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and \\ndelirium. He lost consciousness.\\nNot more than five minutes had passed when he jumped \\nup a second time, and at once pounced in a frenzy on his \\nclothes again.\\n‘How could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, \\nyes; I have not taken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it, for-\\ngot a thing like that! Such a piece of evidence!’\\nHe pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and \\nthrew the bits among his linen under the pillow.\\n‘Pieces of torn linen couldn’t rouse suspicion, whatever \\nhappened; I think not, I think not, any way!’ he repeated, \\nstanding in the middle of the room, and with painful con-\\ncentration he fell to gazing about him again, at the floor and \\neverywhere, trying to make sure he had not forgotten any-\\nthing. The conviction that all his faculties, even memory, \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf646\\uf649\\nand the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began \\nto be an insufferable torture.\\n‘Surely it isn’t beginning already! Surely it isn’t my pun-\\nishment coming upon me? It is!’\\nThe frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually \\nlying on the floor in the middle of the room, where anyone \\ncoming in would see them!\\n‘What is the matter with me!’ he cried again, like one dis-\\ntraught.\\nThen a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all \\nhis clothes were covered with blood, that, perhaps, there \\nwere a great many stains, but that he did not see them, did \\nnot notice them because his perceptions were failing, were \\ngoing to pieces … his reason was clouded…. Suddenly he \\nremembered that there had been blood on the purse too. \\n‘Ah! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put \\nthe wet purse in my pocket!’\\nIn a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!—\\nthere were traces, stains on the lining of the pocket!\\n‘So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have \\nsome sense and memory, since I guessed it of myself,’ he \\nthought triumphantly, with a deep sigh of relief; ‘it’s simply \\nthe weakness of fever, a moment’s delirium,’ and he tore the \\nwhole lining out of the left pocket of his trousers. At that \\ninstant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the sock which \\npoked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces! He \\nflung off his boots; ‘traces indeed! The tip of the sock was \\nsoaked with blood;’ he must have unwarily stepped into \\nthat pool…. ‘But what am I to do with this now? Where am \\n1\\uf646\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nI to put the sock and rags and pocket?’\\nHe gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the \\nmiddle of the room.\\n‘In the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of \\nall. Burn them? But what can I burn them with? There are \\nno matches even. No, better go out and throw it all away \\nsomewhere. Yes, better throw it away,’ he repeated, sitting \\ndown on the sofa again, ‘and at once, this minute, without \\nlingering …’\\nBut his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the un-\\nbearable icy shivering came over him; again he drew his \\ncoat over him.\\nAnd for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by \\nthe impulse to ‘go off somewhere at once, this moment, and \\nfling it all away, so that it may be out of sight and done with, \\nat once, at once!’ Several times he tried to rise from the sofa, \\nbut could not.\\nHe was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knock-\\ning at his door.\\n‘Open, do, are you dead or alive? He keeps sleeping here!’ \\nshouted Nastasya, banging with her fist on the door. ‘For \\nwhole days together he’s snoring here like a dog! A dog he is \\ntoo. Open I tell you. It’s past ten.’\\n‘Maybe he’s not at home,’ said a man’s voice.\\n‘Ha! that’s the porter’s voice…. What does he want?’\\nHe jumped up and sat on the sofa. The beating of his \\nheart was a positive pain.\\n‘Then who can have latched the door?’ retorted Nastasya. \\n‘He’s taken to bolting himself in! As if he were worth steal-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf646\\uf64b\\ning! Open, you stupid, wake up!’\\n‘What do they want? Why the porter? All’s discovered. \\nResist or open? Come what may! …’\\nHe half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door.\\nHis room was so small that he could undo the latch \\nwithout leaving the bed. Yes; the porter and Nastasya were \\nstanding there.\\nNastasya stared at him in a strange way. He glanced with \\na defiant and desperate air at the porter, who without a word \\nheld out a grey folded paper sealed with bottle-wax.',\n",
              " '‘A notice from the office,’ he announced, as he gave him \\nthe paper.\\n‘From what office?’\\n‘A summons to the police office, of course. You know \\nwhich office.’\\n‘To the police? … What for? …’\\n‘How can I tell? You’re sent for, so you go.’\\nThe man looked at him attentively, looked round the \\nroom and turned to go away.\\n‘He’s downright ill!’ observed Nastasya, not taking her \\neyes off him. The porter turned his head for a moment. ‘He’s \\nbeen in a fever since yesterday,’ she added.\\nRaskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his \\nhands, without opening it. ‘Don’t you get up then,’ Nastasya \\nwent on compassionately, seeing that he was letting his feet \\ndown from the sofa. ‘You’re ill, and so don’t go; there’s no \\nsuch hurry. What have you got there?’\\nHe looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had \\ncut from his trousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. \\n1\\uf646\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nSo he had been asleep with them in his hand. Afterwards \\nreflecting upon it, he remembered that half waking up in \\nhis fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand and so \\nfallen asleep again.\\n‘Look at the rags he’s collected and sleeps with them, as \\nthough he has got hold of a treasure …’\\nAnd Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.\\nInstantly he thrust them all under his great coat and \\nfixed his eyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being \\ncapable of rational reflection at that moment, he felt that no \\none would behave like that with a person who was going to \\nbe arrested. ‘But … the police?’\\n‘You’d better have some tea! Yes? I’ll bring it, there’s \\nsome left.’\\n‘No … I’m going; I’ll go at once,’ he muttered, getting on \\nto his feet.\\n‘Why, you’ll never get downstairs!’\\n‘Yes, I’ll go.’\\n‘As you please.’\\nShe followed the porter out.\\nAt once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and \\nthe rags.\\n‘There are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with \\ndirt, and rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had \\nno suspicion could distinguish anything. Nastasya from a \\ndistance could not have noticed, thank God!’ Then with a \\ntremor he broke the seal of the notice and began reading; he \\nwas a long while reading, before he understood. It was an \\nordinary summons from the district police-station to ap-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf6470\\npear that day at half-past nine at the office of the district \\nsuperintendent.\\n‘But when has such a thing happened? I never have \\nanything to do with the police! And why just to-day?’ he \\nthought in agonising bewilderment. ‘Good God, only get \\nit over soon!’\\nHe was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke \\ninto laughter —not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.\\nHe began, hurriedly dressing. ‘If I’m lost, I am lost, I \\ndon’t care! Shall I put the sock on?’ he suddenly wondered, \\n‘it will get dustier still and the traces will be gone.’\\nBut no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again \\nin loathing and horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that \\nhe had no other socks, he picked it up and put it on again—\\nand again he laughed.\\n‘That’s all conventional, that’s all relative, merely a way \\nof looking at it,’ he thought in a flash, but only on the top \\nsurface of his mind, while he was shuddering all over, ‘there, \\nI’ve got it on! I have finished by getting it on!’\\nBut his laughter was quickly followed by despair.\\n‘No, it’s too much for me …’ he thought. His legs shook. \\n‘From fear,’ he muttered. His head swam and ached with fe-\\nver. ‘It’s a trick! They want to decoy me there and confound \\nme over everything,’ he mused, as he went out on to the \\nstairs—‘the worst of it is I’m almost light-headed … I may \\nblurt out something stupid …’\\nOn the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the \\nthings just as they were in the hole in the wall, ‘and very \\nlikely, it’s on purpose to search when I’m out,’ he thought, \\n1\\uf6471\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.',\n",
              " 'com\\nand stopped short. But he was possessed by such despair, \\nsuch cynicism of misery, if one may so call it, that with a \\nwave of his hand he went on. ‘Only to get it over!’\\nIn the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop \\nof rain had fallen all those days. Again dust, bricks and \\nmortar, again the stench from the shops and pot-houses, \\nagain the drunken men, the Finnish pedlars and half-bro-\\nken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes, so that \\nit hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going \\nround—as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out \\ninto the street on a bright sunny day.\\nWhen he reached the turning into the street, in an agony \\nof trepidation he looked down it … at the house … and at \\nonce averted his eyes.\\n‘If they question me, perhaps I’ll simply tell,’ he thought, \\nas he drew near the police-station.\\nThe police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It \\nhad lately been moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a \\nnew house. He had been once for a moment in the old office \\nbut long ago. Turning in at the gateway, he saw on the right \\na flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with a book \\nin his hand. ‘A house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is \\nhere,’ and he began ascending the stairs on the chance. He \\ndid not want to ask questions of anyone.\\n‘I’ll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything …’ he \\nthought, as he reached the fourth floor.\\nThe staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty \\nwater. The kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and \\nstood open almost the whole day. So there was a fearful \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf647\\uf645\\nsmell and heat. The staircase was crowded with porters \\ngoing up and down with their books under their arms, po-\\nlicemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door \\nof the office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood wait-\\ning within. There, too, the heat was stifling and there was \\na sickening smell of fresh paint and stale oil from the newly \\ndecorated rooms.\\nAfter waiting a little, he decided to move forward into \\nthe next room. All the rooms were small and low-pitched. \\nA fearful impatience drew him on and on. No one paid at-\\ntention to him. In the second room some clerks sat writing, \\ndressed hardly better than he was, and rather a queer-look-\\ning set. He went up to one of them.\\n‘What is it?’\\nHe showed the notice he had received.\\n‘You are a student?’ the man asked, glancing at the no-\\ntice.\\n‘Yes, formerly a student.’\\nThe clerk looked at him, but without the slightest inter-\\nest. He was a particularly unkempt person with the look of \\na fixed idea in his eye.\\n‘There would be no getting anything out of him, because \\nhe has no interest in anything,’ thought Raskolnikov.\\n‘Go in there to the head clerk,’ said the clerk, pointing to-\\nwards the furthest room.\\nHe went into that room—the fourth in order; it was a \\nsmall room and packed full of people, rather better dressed \\nthan in the outer rooms. Among them were two ladies. One, \\npoorly dressed in mourning, sat at the table opposite the \\n1\\uf647\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nchief clerk, writing something at his dictation. The other, a \\nvery stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face, \\nexcessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as \\nbig as a saucer, was standing on one side, apparently wait-\\ning for something. Raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the \\nhead clerk.',\n",
              " 'The latter glanced at it, said: ‘Wait a minute,’ and \\nwent on attending to the lady in mourning.\\nHe breathed more freely. ‘It can’t be that!’\\nBy degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging \\nhimself to have courage and be calm.\\n‘Some foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may \\nbetray myself! Hm … it’s a pity there’s no air here,’ he add-\\ned, ‘it’s stifling…. It makes one’s head dizzier than ever … \\nand one’s mind too …’\\nHe was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. He was \\nafraid of losing his self-control; he tried to catch at some-\\nthing and fix his mind on it, something quite irrelevant, but \\nhe could not succeed in this at all. Yet the head clerk great-\\nly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him and \\nguess something from his face.\\nHe was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a \\ndark mobile face that looked older than his years. He was \\nfashionably dressed and foppish, with his hair parted in the \\nmiddle, well combed and pomaded, and wore a number of \\nrings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain on his \\nwaistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner \\nwho was in the room, and said them fairly correctly.\\n‘Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down,’ he said casually to the \\ngaily- dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf647\\uf647\\nthough not venturing to sit down, though there was a chair \\nbeside her.\\n‘Ich danke,’ said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk \\nshe sank into the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with \\nwhite lace floated about the table like an air-balloon and \\nfilled almost half the room. She smelt of scent. But she was \\nobviously embarrassed at filling half the room and smelling \\nso strongly of scent; and though her smile was impudent as \\nwell as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.\\nThe lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. All \\nat once, with some noise, an officer walked in very jaun-\\ntily, with a peculiar swing of his shoulders at each step. He \\ntossed his cockaded cap on the table and sat down in an \\neasy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from her seat \\non seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; \\nbut the officer took not the smallest notice of her, and she \\ndid not venture to sit down again in his presence. He was \\nthe assistant superintendent. He had a reddish moustache \\nthat stood out horizontally on each side of his face, and ex-\\ntremely small features, expressive of nothing much except a \\ncertain insolence. He looked askance and rather indignant-\\nly at Raskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite \\nof his humiliating position, his bearing was by no means in \\nkeeping with his clothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a \\nvery long and direct look on him, so that he felt positively \\naffronted.\\n‘What do you want?’ he shouted, apparently astonished \\nthat such a ragged fellow was not annihilated by the maj-\\nesty of his glance.\\n1\\uf647\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘I was summoned … by a notice …’ Raskolnikov fal-\\ntered.\\n‘For the recovery of money due, from the student ’ the \\nhead clerk interfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his \\npapers. ‘Here!’ and he flung Raskolnikov a document and \\npointed out the place. ‘Read that!’\\n‘Money? What money?’ thought Raskolnikov, ‘but … \\nthen … it’s certainly not that. ’\\nAnd he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense inde-\\nscribable relief. A load was lifted from his back.\\n‘And pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?’ \\nshouted the assistant superintendent, seeming for some un-\\nknown reason more and more aggrieved. ‘You are told to \\ncome at nine, and now it’s twelve!’\\n‘The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour \\nago,’ Raskolnikov answered loudly over his shoulder. To his \\nown surprise he, too, grew suddenly angry and found a cer-\\ntain pleasure in it. ‘And it’s enough that I have come here ill \\nwith fever.’\\n‘Kindly refrain from shouting!’\\n‘I’m not shouting, I’m speaking very quietly, it’s you who \\nare shouting at me. I’m a student, and allow no one to shout \\nat me.’\\nThe assistant superintendent was so furious that for the \\nfirst minute he could only splutter inarticulately. He leaped \\nup from his seat.',\n",
              " '‘Be silent! You are in a government office. Don’t be im-\\npudent, sir!’\\n‘You’re in a government office, too,’ cried Raskolnikov, \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf647\\uf649\\n‘and you’re smoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you \\nare showing disrespect to all of us.’\\nHe felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.\\nThe head clerk looked at him with a smile. The angry as-\\nsistant superintendent was obviously disconcerted.\\n‘That’s not your business!’ he shouted at last with un-\\nnatural loudness. ‘Kindly make the declaration demanded \\nof you. Show him. Alexandr Grigorievitch. There is a com-\\nplaint against you! You don’t pay your debts! You’re a fine \\nbird!’\\nBut Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly \\nclutched at the paper, in haste to find an explanation. He \\nread it once, and a second time, and still did not under-\\nstand.\\n‘What is this?’ he asked the head clerk.\\n‘It is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ. You \\nmust either pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give \\na written declaration when you can pay it, and at the same \\ntime an undertaking not to leave the capital without pay-\\nment, and nor to sell or conceal your property. The creditor \\nis at liberty to sell your property, and proceed against you \\naccording to the law.’\\n‘But I … am not in debt to anyone!’\\n‘That’s not our business. Here, an I O U for a hundred \\nand fifteen roubles, legally attested, and due for payment, \\nhas been brought us for recovery, given by you to the widow \\nof the assessor Zarnitsyn, nine months ago, and paid over \\nby the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov. We therefore \\nsummon you, hereupon.’\\n1\\uf647\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘But she is my landlady!’\\n‘And what if she is your landlady?’\\nThe head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile \\nof compassion, and at the same time with a certain triumph, \\nas at a novice under fire for the first time—as though he \\nwould say: ‘Well, how do you feel now?’ But what did he \\ncare now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery! Was that worth \\nworrying about now, was it worth attention even! He stood, \\nhe read, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions \\nhimself, but all mechanically. The triumphant sense of se-\\ncurity, of deliverance from overwhelming danger, that was \\nwhat filled his whole soul that moment without thought for \\nthe future, without analysis, without suppositions or sur-\\nmises, without doubts and without questioning. It was an \\ninstant of full, direct, purely instinctive joy. But at that very \\nmoment something like a thunderstorm took place in the \\noffice. The assistant superintendent, still shaken by Raskol-\\nnikov’s disrespect, still fuming and obviously anxious to \\nkeep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the unfortunate \\nsmart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came \\nin with an exceedingly silly smile.\\n‘You shameful hussy!’ he shouted suddenly at the top of \\nhis voice. (The lady in mourning had left the office.) ‘What \\nwas going on at your house last night? Eh! A disgrace again, \\nyou’re a scandal to the whole street. Fighting and drinking \\nagain. Do you want the house of correction? Why, I have \\nwarned you ten times over that I would not let you off the \\neleventh! And here you are again, again, you … you … !’\\nThe paper fell out of Raskolnikov’s hands, and he looked \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf647\\uf64b\\nwildly at the smart lady who was so unceremoniously treat-\\ned. But he soon saw what it meant, and at once began to find \\npositive amusement in the scandal. He listened with plea-\\nsure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh … all his nerves \\nwere on edge.\\n‘Ilya Petrovitch!’ the head clerk was beginning anxiously, \\nbut stopped short, for he knew from experience that the en-\\nraged assistant could not be stopped except by force.\\nAs for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled be-\\nfore the storm. But, strange to say, the more numerous and \\nviolent the terms of abuse became, the more amiable she \\nlooked, and the more seductive the smiles she lavished on \\nthe terrible assistant. She moved uneasily, and curtsied in-\\ncessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her \\nword: and at last she found it.\\n‘There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. \\nCaptain,’ she pattered all at once, like peas dropping, speak-\\ning Russian confidently, though with a strong German \\naccent, ‘and no sort of scandal, and his honour came drunk, \\nand it’s the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain, and I am \\nnot to blame…. Mine is an honourable house, Mr.',\n",
              " 'Captain, \\nand honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, al-\\nways dislike any scandal myself. But he came quite tipsy, \\nand asked for three bottles again, and then he lifted up one \\nleg, and began playing the pianoforte with one foot, and \\nthat is not at all right in an honourable house, and he ganz \\nbroke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I \\nsaid so. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone \\nwith it. And then I called the porter, and Karl came, and he \\n1\\uf647\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ntook Karl and hit him in the eye; and he hit Henriette in the \\neye, too, and gave me five slaps on the cheek. And it was so \\nungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain, and I \\nscreamed. And he opened the window over the canal, and \\nstood in the window, squealing like a little pig; it was a dis-\\ngrace. The idea of squealing like a little pig at the window \\ninto the street! Fie upon him! And Karl pulled him away \\nfrom the window by his coat, and it is true, Mr. Captain, he \\ntore sein rock. And then he shouted that man muss pay him \\nfifteen roubles damages. And I did pay him, Mr. Captain, \\nfive roubles for sein rock. And he is an ungentlemanly visi-\\ntor and caused all the scandal. ‘I will show you up,’ he said, \\n‘for I can write to all the papers about you.’’\\n‘Then he was an author?’\\n‘Yes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in \\nan honourable house….’\\n‘Now then! Enough! I have told you already …’\\n‘Ilya Petrovitch!’ the head clerk repeated significantly.\\nThe assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk \\nslightly shook his head.\\n‘… So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, \\nand I tell it you for the last time,’ the assistant went on. ‘If \\nthere is a scandal in your honourable house once again, I \\nwill put you yourself in the lock-up, as it is called in polite \\nsociety. Do you hear? So a literary man, an author took five \\nroubles for his coat-tail in an ‘honourable house’? A nice set, \\nthese authors!’\\nAnd he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. \\n‘There was a scandal the other day in a restaurant, too. An \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf6480\\nauthor had eaten his dinner and would not pay; ‘I’ll write \\na satire on you,’ says he. And there was another of them \\non a steamer last week used the most disgraceful language \\nto the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife and \\ndaughter. And there was one of them turned out of a con-\\nfectioner’s shop the other day. They are like that, authors, \\nliterary men, students, town-criers…. Pfoo! You get along! I \\nshall look in upon you myself one day. Then you had better \\nbe careful! Do you hear?’\\nWith hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying \\nin all directions, and so curtsied herself to the door. But at \\nthe door, she stumbled backwards against a good-looking \\nofficer with a fresh, open face and splendid thick fair whis-\\nkers. This was the superintendent of the district himself, \\nNikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna made haste to curtsy \\nalmost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she \\nfluttered out of the office.\\n‘Again thunder and lightning—a hurricane!’ said \\nNikodim Fomitch to Ilya Petrovitch in a civil and friendly \\ntone. ‘You are aroused again, you are fuming again! I heard \\nit on the stairs!’\\n‘Well, what then!’ Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentle-\\nmanly nonchalance; and he walked with some papers to \\nanother table, with a jaunty swing of his shoulders at each \\nstep. ‘Here, if you will kindly look: an author, or a student, \\nhas been one at least, does not pay his debts, has given an I O \\nU, won’t clear out of his room, and complaints are constant-\\nly being lodged against him, and here he has been pleased to \\nmake a protest against my smoking in his presence! He be-\\n1\\uf6481\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nhaves like a cad himself, and just look at him, please. Here’s \\nthe gentleman, and very attractive he is!’\\n‘Poverty is not a vice, my friend, but we know you go off \\nlike powder, you can’t bear a slight, I daresay you took of-\\nfence at something and went too far yourself,’ continued \\nNikodim Fomitch, turning affably to Raskolnikov. ‘But you \\nwere wrong there; he is a capital fellow, I assure you, but ex-\\nplosive, explosive! He gets hot, fires up, boils over, and no \\nstopping him! And then it’s all over! And at the bottom he’s \\na heart of gold! His nickname in the regiment was the Ex-\\nplosive Lieutenant….’\\n‘And what a regiment it was, too,’ cried Ilya Petrovitch, \\nmuch gratified at this agreeable banter, though still sulky.',\n",
              " 'Raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something ex-\\nceptionally pleasant to them all. ‘Excuse me, Captain,’ he \\nbegan easily, suddenly addressing Nikodim Fomitch, ‘will \\nyou enter into my position? … I am ready to ask pardon, if I \\nhave been ill-mannered. I am a poor student, sick and shat-\\ntered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty. I am not \\nstudying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get \\nmoney…. I have a mother and sister in the province of X. \\nThey will send it to me, and I will pay. My landlady is a good- \\nhearted woman, but she is so exasperated at my having lost \\nmy lessons, and not paying her for the last four months, that \\nshe does not even send up my dinner … and I don’t under-\\nstand this I O U at all. She is asking me to pay her on this I \\nO U. How am I to pay her? Judge for yourselves! …’\\n‘But that is not our business, you know,’ the head clerk \\nwas observing.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf648\\uf645\\n‘Yes, yes. I perfectly agree with you. But allow me to ex-\\nplain …’ Raskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim \\nFomitch, but trying his best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, \\nthough the latter persistently appeared to be rummag-\\ning among his papers and to be contemptuously oblivious \\nof him. ‘Allow me to explain that I have been living with \\nher for nearly three years and at first … at first … for why \\nshould I not confess it, at the very beginning I promised to \\nmarry her daughter, it was a verbal promise, freely given … \\nshe was a girl … indeed, I liked her, though I was not in love \\nwith her … a youthful affair in fact … that is, I mean to say, \\nthat my landlady gave me credit freely in those days, and I \\nled a life of … I was very heedless …’\\n‘Nobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we’ve \\nno time to waste,’ Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and \\nwith a note of triumph; but Raskolnikov stopped him hotly, \\nthough he suddenly found it exceedingly difficult to speak.\\n‘But excuse me, excuse me. It is for me to explain … how \\nit all happened … In my turn … though I agree with you \\n… it is unnecessary. But a year ago, the girl died of typhus. \\nI remained lodging there as before, and when my landlady \\nmoved into her present quarters, she said to me … and in a \\nfriendly way … that she had complete trust in me, but still, \\nwould I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen \\nroubles, all the debt I owed her. She said if only I gave her \\nthat, she would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that \\nshe would never, never—those were her own words—make \\nuse of that I O U till I could pay of myself … and now, when \\nI have lost my lessons and have nothing to eat, she takes ac-\\n1\\uf648\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ntion against me. What am I to say to that?’\\n‘All these affecting details are no business of ours.’ Ilya \\nPetrovitch interrupted rudely. ‘You must give a written un-\\ndertaking but as for your love affairs and all these tragic \\nevents, we have nothing to do with that.’\\n‘Come now … you are harsh,’ muttered Nikodim Fomi-\\ntch, sitting down at the table and also beginning to write. \\nHe looked a little ashamed.\\n‘Write!’ said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.\\n‘Write what?’ the latter asked, gruffly.\\n‘I will dictate to you.’\\nRaskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more \\ncasually and contemptuously after his speech, but strange \\nto say he suddenly felt completely indifferent to anyone’s \\nopinion, and this revulsion took place in a flash, in one in-\\nstant. If he had cared to think a little, he would have been \\namazed indeed that he could have talked to them like that \\na minute before, forcing his feelings upon them. And where \\nhad those feelings come from? Now if the whole room had \\nbeen filled, not with police officers, but with those nearest \\nand dearest to him, he would not have found one human \\nword for them, so empty was his heart. A gloomy sensa-\\ntion of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took \\nconscious form in his soul. It was not the meanness of his \\nsentimental effusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the mean-\\nness of the latter’s triumph over him that had caused this \\nsudden revulsion in his heart. Oh, what had he to do now \\nwith his own baseness, with all these petty vanities, offi-\\ncers, German women, debts, police- offices? If he had been \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf648\\uf647\\nsentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have \\nstirred, would hardly have heard the sentence to the end. \\nSomething was happening to him entirely new, sudden and \\nunknown. It was not that he understood, but he felt clearly \\nwith all the intensity of sensation that he could never more \\nappeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental \\neffusions like his recent outburst, or with anything what-\\never; and that if they had been his own brothers and sisters \\nand not police-officers, it would have been utterly out of the \\nquestion to appeal to them in any circumstance of life. He \\nhad never experienced such a strange and awful sensation. \\nAnd what was most agonising—it was more a sensation than \\na conception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising \\nof all the sensations he had known in his life.\\nThe head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of \\ndeclaration, that he could not pay, that he undertook to do \\nso at a future date, that he would not leave the town, nor sell \\nhis property, and so on.\\n‘But you can’t write, you can hardly hold the pen,’ ob-\\nserved the head clerk, looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov. \\n‘Are you ill?’\\n‘Yes, I am giddy.',\n",
              " 'Go on!’\\n‘That’s all. Sign it.’\\nThe head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to \\nothers.\\nRaskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up \\nand going away, he put his elbows on the table and pressed \\nhis head in his hands. He felt as if a nail were being driven \\ninto his skull. A strange idea suddenly occurred to him, to \\n1\\uf648\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nget up at once, to go up to Nikodim Fomitch, and tell him \\neverything that had happened yesterday, and then to go \\nwith him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the \\nhole in the corner. The impulse was so strong that he got up \\nfrom his seat to carry it out. ‘Hadn’t I better think a minute?’ \\nflashed through his mind. ‘No, better cast off the burden \\nwithout thinking.’ But all at once he stood still, rooted to \\nthe spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly with Ilya \\nPetrovitch, and the words reached him:\\n‘It’s impossible, they’ll both be released. To begin with, \\nthe whole story contradicts itself. Why should they have \\ncalled the porter, if it had been their doing? To inform \\nagainst themselves? Or as a blind? No, that would be too \\ncunning! Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at the \\ngate by both the porters and a woman as he went in. He \\nwas walking with three friends, who left him only at the \\ngate, and he asked the porters to direct him, in the pres-\\nence of the friends. Now, would he have asked his way if he \\nhad been going with such an object? As for Koch, he spent \\nhalf an hour at the silversmith’s below, before he went up to \\nthe old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight. \\nNow just consider …’\\n‘But excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction? \\nThey state themselves that they knocked and the door was \\nlocked; yet three minutes later when they went up with the \\nporter, it turned out the door was unfastened.’\\n‘That’s just it; the murderer must have been there and \\nbolted himself in; and they’d have caught him for a certain-\\nty if Koch had not been an ass and gone to look for the porter \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf648\\uf649\\ntoo. He must have seized the interval to get downstairs and \\nslip by them somehow. Koch keeps crossing himself and \\nsaying: ‘If I had been there, he would have jumped out and \\nkilled me with his axe.’ He is going to have a thanksgiving \\nservice—ha, ha!’\\n‘And no one saw the murderer?’\\n‘They might well not see him; the house is a regular No-\\nah’s Ark,’ said the head clerk, who was listening.\\n‘It’s clear, quite clear,’ Nikodim Fomitch repeated warm-\\nly.\\n‘No, it is anything but clear,’ Ilya Petrovitch maintained.\\nRaskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the \\ndoor, but he did not reach it….\\nWhen he recovered consciousness, he found himself \\nsitting in a chair, supported by someone on the right side, \\nwhile someone else was standing on the left, holding a yel-\\nlowish glass filled with yellow water, and Nikodim Fomitch \\nstanding before him, looking intently at him. He got up \\nfrom the chair.\\n‘What’s this? Are you ill?’ Nikodim Fomitch asked, rath-\\ner sharply.\\n‘He could hardly hold his pen when he was signing,’ said \\nthe head clerk, settling back in his place, and taking up his \\nwork again.\\n‘Have you been ill long?’ cried Ilya Petrovitch from his \\nplace, where he, too, was looking through papers. He had, \\nof course, come to look at the sick man when he fainted, but \\nretired at once when he recovered.\\n‘Since yesterday,’ muttered Raskolnikov in reply.\\n1\\uf648\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘Did you go out yesterday?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘Though you were ill?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘At what time?’\\n‘About seven.’\\n‘And where did you go, my I ask?’\\n‘Along the street.’\\n‘Short and clear.’\\nRaskolnikov, white as a handkerchief, had answered \\nsharply, jerkily, without dropping his black feverish eyes \\nbefore Ilya Petrovitch’s stare.\\n‘He can scarcely stand upright. And you …’ Nikodim \\nFomitch was beginning.',\n",
              " '‘No matter,’ Ilya Petrovitch pronounced rather peculiar-\\nly.\\nNikodim Fomitch would have made some further pro-\\ntest, but glancing at the head clerk who was looking very \\nhard at him, he did not speak. There was a sudden silence. \\nIt was strange.\\n‘Very well, then,’ concluded Ilya Petrovitch, ‘we will not \\ndetain you.’\\nRaskolnikov went out. He caught the sound of eager \\nconversation on his departure, and above the rest rose the \\nquestioning voice of Nikodim Fomitch. In the street, his \\nfaintness passed off completely.\\n‘A search—there will be a search at once,’ he repeated to \\nhimself, hurrying home. ‘The brutes! they suspect.’\\nHis former terror mastered him completely again.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf648\\uf64b\\nChapter II\\n‘A\\nnd what if there has been a search already? What if I \\nfind them in my room?’\\nBut here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one \\nhad peeped in. Even Nastasya had not touched it. But heav-\\nens! how could he have left all those things in the hole?\\nHe rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the pa-\\nper, pulled the things out and lined his pockets with them. \\nThere were eight articles in all: two little boxes with ear-rings \\nor something of the sort, he hardly looked to see; then four \\nsmall leather cases. There was a chain, too, merely wrapped \\nin newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked \\nlike a decoration…. He put them all in the different pockets \\nof his overcoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, \\ntrying to conceal them as much as possible. He took the \\npurse, too. Then he went out of his room, leaving the door \\nopen. He walked quickly and resolutely, and though he felt \\nshattered, he had his senses about him. He was afraid of \\npursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another \\nquarter of an hour perhaps, instructions would be issued \\nfor his pursuit, and so at all costs, he must hide all traces \\nbefore then. He must clear everything up while he still had \\nsome strength, some reasoning power left him…. Where \\nwas he to go?\\nThat had long been settled: ‘Fling them into the canal, \\n1\\uf648\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nand all traces hidden in the water, the thing would be at an \\nend.’ So he had decided in the night of his delirium when \\nseveral times he had had the impulse to get up and go away, \\nto make haste, and get rid of it all. But to get rid of it, turned \\nout to be a very difficult task. He wandered along the bank \\nof the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and \\nlooked several times at the steps running down to the wa-\\nter, but he could not think of carrying out his plan; either \\nrafts stood at the steps’ edge, and women were washing \\nclothes on them, or boats were moored there, and people \\nwere swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and \\nnoticed from the banks on all sides; it would look suspi-\\ncious for a man to go down on purpose, stop, and throw \\nsomething into the water. And what if the boxes were to \\nfloat instead of sinking? And of course they would. Even as \\nit was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as \\nif they had nothing to do but to watch him. ‘Why is it, or \\ncan it be my fancy?’ he thought.\\nAt last the thought struck him that it might be better to \\ngo to the Neva. There were not so many people there, he \\nwould be less observed, and it would be more convenient \\nin every way, above all it was further off. He wondered how \\nhe could have been wandering for a good half- hour, wor-\\nried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking \\nof it before. And that half-hour he had lost over an irratio-\\nnal plan, simply because he had thought of it in delirium! \\nHe had become extremely absent and forgetful and he was \\naware of it. He certainly must make haste.\\nHe walked towards the Neva along V—— Prospect, but \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf6490\\non the way another idea struck him. ‘Why to the Neva? \\nWould it not be better to go somewhere far off, to the Is-\\nlands again, and there hide the things in some solitary place, \\nin a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot perhaps?’ And \\nthough he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea seemed \\nto him a sound one.',\n",
              " 'But he was not destined to go there. \\nFor coming out of V—— Prospect towards the square, he \\nsaw on the left a passage leading between two blank walls to \\na courtyard. On the right hand, the blank unwhitewashed \\nwall of a four-storied house stretched far into the court; on \\nthe left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for twen-\\nty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. \\nHere was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of dif-\\nferent sorts was lying. At the end of the court, the corner of \\na low, smutty, stone shed, apparently part of some work-\\nshop, peeped from behind the hoarding. It was probably a \\ncarriage builder’s or carpenter’s shed; the whole place from \\nthe entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the \\nplace to throw it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, \\nhe slipped in, and at once saw near the gate a sink, such as \\nis often put in yards where there are many workmen or cab-\\ndrivers; and on the hoarding above had been scribbled in \\nchalk the time-honoured witticism, ‘Standing here strictly \\nforbidden.’ This was all the better, for there would be noth-\\ning suspicious about his going in. ‘Here I could throw it all \\nin a heap and get away!’\\nLooking round once more, with his hand already in his \\npocket, he noticed against the outer wall, between the en-\\ntrance and the sink, a big unhewn stone, weighing perhaps \\n1\\uf6491\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nsixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a street. He \\ncould hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but \\nhe could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone \\ncame in from the street, which might well happen indeed, \\nso there was need of haste.\\nHe bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in \\nboth hands, and using all his strength turned it over. Under \\nthe stone was a small hollow in the ground, and he immedi-\\nately emptied his pocket into it. The purse lay at the top, and \\nyet the hollow was not filled up. Then he seized the stone \\nagain and with one twist turned it back, so that it was in the \\nsame position again, though it stood a very little higher. But \\nhe scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with \\nhis foot. Nothing could be noticed.\\nThen he went out, and turned into the square. Again an \\nintense, almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an in-\\nstant, as it had in the police-office. ‘I have buried my tracks! \\nAnd who, who can think of looking under that stone? It has \\nbeen lying there most likely ever since the house was built, \\nand will lie as many years more. And if it were found, who \\nwould think of me? It is all over! No clue!’ And he laughed. \\nYes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous \\nnoiseless laugh, and went on laughing all the time he was \\ncrossing the square. But when he reached the K—— Bou-\\nlevard where two days before he had come upon that girl, \\nhis laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his \\nmind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass \\nthat seat on which after the girl was gone, he had sat and \\npondered, and that it would be hateful, too, to meet that \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf649\\uf645\\nwhiskered policeman to whom he had given the twenty co-\\npecks: ‘Damn him!’\\nHe walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. \\nAll his ideas now seemed to be circling round some single \\npoint, and he felt that there really was such a point, and that \\nnow, now, he was left facing that point—and for the first \\ntime, indeed, during the last two months.\\n‘Damn it all!’ he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovern-\\nable fury. ‘If it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new \\nlife! Good Lord, how stupid it is! … And what lies I told \\nto-day! How despicably I fawned upon that wretched Ilya \\nPetrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I care for them all, \\nand my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It is not \\nthat at all!’\\nSuddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and \\nexceedingly simple question perplexed and bitterly con-\\nfounded him.\\n‘If it all has really been done deliberately and not idioti-\\ncally, if I really had a certain and definite object, how is it \\nI did not even glance into the purse and don’t know what I \\nhad there, for which I have undergone these agonies, and \\nhave deliberately undertaken this base, filthy degrading \\nbusiness? And here I wanted at once to throw into the water \\nthe purse together with all the things which I had not seen \\neither … how’s that?’\\nYes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all \\nbefore, and it was not a new question for him, even when \\nit was decided in the night without hesitation and con-\\nsideration, as though so it must be, as though it could not \\n1\\uf649\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\npossibly be otherwise…. Yes, he had known it all, and un-\\nderstood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday \\nat the moment when he was bending over the box and pull-\\ning the jewel-cases out of it…. Yes, so it was.\\n‘It is because I am very ill,’ he decided grimly at last, ‘I \\nhave been worrying and fretting myself, and I don’t know \\nwhat I am doing…. Yesterday and the day before yesterday \\nand all this time I have been worrying myself…. I shall get \\nwell and I shall not worry…. But what if I don’t get well at \\nall? Good God, how sick I am of it all!’\\nHe walked on without resting.',\n",
              " 'He had a terrible longing \\nfor some distraction, but he did not know what to do, what \\nto attempt. A new overwhelming sensation was gaining \\nmore and more mastery over him every moment; this was \\nan immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for everything \\nsurrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred. \\nAll who met him were loathsome to him—he loathed their \\nfaces, their movements, their gestures. If anyone had ad-\\ndressed him, he felt that he might have spat at him or bitten \\nhim….\\nHe stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the \\nLittle Neva, near the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. ‘Why, \\nhe lives here, in that house,’ he thought, ‘why, I have not \\ncome to Razumihin of my own accord! Here it’s the same \\nthing over again…. Very interesting to know, though; have \\nI come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? \\nNever mind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go \\nand see him the day after; well, and so I will! Besides I really \\ncannot go further now.’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf649\\uf647\\nHe went up to Razumihin’s room on the fifth floor.\\nThe latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at \\nthe moment, and he opened the door himself. It was four \\nmonths since they had seen each other. Razumihin was sit-\\nting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on his bare \\nfeet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. His face showed \\nsurprise.\\n‘Is it you?’ he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; \\nthen after a brief pause, he whistled. ‘As hard up as all that! \\nWhy, brother, you’ve cut me out!’ he added, looking at \\nRaskolnikov’s rags. ‘Come sit down, you are tired, I’ll be \\nbound.’\\nAnd when he had sunk down on the American leather \\nsofa, which was in even worse condition than his own, Ra-\\nzumihin saw at once that his visitor was ill.\\n‘Why, you are seriously ill, do you know that?’ He began \\nfeeling his pulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.\\n‘Never mind,’ he said, ‘I have come for this: I have no les-\\nsons…. I wanted, … but I don’t really want lessons….’\\n‘But I say! You are delirious, you know!’ Razumihin ob-\\nserved, watching him carefully.\\n‘No, I am not.’\\nRaskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted \\nthe stairs to Razumihin’s, he had not realised that he would \\nbe meeting his friend face to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, \\nthat what he was least of all disposed for at that moment \\nwas to be face to face with anyone in the wide world. His \\nspleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at him-\\nself as soon as he crossed Razumihin’s threshold.\\n1\\uf649\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘Good-bye,’ he said abruptly, and walked to the door.\\n‘Stop, stop! You queer fish.’\\n‘I don’t want to,’ said the other, again pulling away his \\nhand.\\n‘Then why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or \\nwhat? Why, this is … almost insulting! I won’t let you go \\nlike that.’\\n‘Well, then, I came to you because I know no one but \\nyou who could help … to begin … because you are kinder \\nthan anyone— cleverer, I mean, and can judge … and now \\nI see that I want nothing. Do you hear? Nothing at all … no \\none’s services … no one’s sympathy. I am by myself … alone. \\nCome, that’s enough. Leave me alone.’\\n‘Stay a minute, you sweep! You are a perfect madman. As \\nyou like for all I care.',\n",
              " 'I have no lessons, do you see, and I \\ndon’t care about that, but there’s a bookseller, Heruvimov—\\nand he takes the place of a lesson. I would not exchange him \\nfor five lessons. He’s doing publishing of a kind, and issuing \\nnatural science manuals and what a circulation they have! \\nThe very titles are worth the money! You always maintained \\nthat I was a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools \\nthan I am! Now he is setting up for being advanced, not that \\nhe has an inkling of anything, but, of course, I encourage \\nhim. Here are two signatures of the German text—in my \\nopinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses the question, \\n‘Is woman a human being?’ And, of course, triumphantly \\nproves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this \\nwork as a contribution to the woman question; I am trans-\\nlating it; he will expand these two and a half signatures \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf649\\uf649\\ninto six, we shall make up a gorgeous title half a page long \\nand bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He pays me six \\nroubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles \\nfor the job, and I’ve had six already in advance. When we \\nhave finished this, we are going to begin a translation about \\nwhales, and then some of the dullest scandals out of the sec-\\nond part of Les Confessions we have marked for translation; \\nsomebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was a kind of \\nRadishchev. You may be sure I don’t contradict him, hang \\nhim! Well, would you like to do the second signature of ‘Is \\nwoman a human being?’ If you would, take the German and \\npens and paper—all those are provided, and take three rou-\\nbles; for as I have had six roubles in advance on the whole \\nthing, three roubles come to you for your share. And when \\nyou have finished the signature there will be another three \\nroubles for you. And please don’t think I am doing you a \\nservice; quite the contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw \\nhow you could help me; to begin with, I am weak in spell-\\ning, and secondly, I am sometimes utterly adrift in German, \\nso that I make it up as I go along for the most part. The \\nonly comfort is, that it’s bound to be a change for the better. \\nThough who can tell, maybe it’s sometimes for the worse. \\nWill you take it?’\\nRaskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took \\nthe three roubles and without a word went out. Razumihin \\ngazed after him in astonishment. But when Raskolnikov \\nwas in the next street, he turned back, mounted the stairs \\nto Razumihin’s again and laying on the table the German \\narticle and the three roubles, went out again, still without \\n1\\uf649\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nuttering a word.\\n‘Are you raving, or what?’ Razumihin shouted, roused to \\nfury at last. ‘What farce is this? You’ll drive me crazy too … \\nwhat did you come to see me for, damn you?’\\n‘I don’t want … translation,’ muttered Raskolnikov from \\nthe stairs.\\n‘Then what the devil do you want?’ shouted Razumihin \\nfrom above. Raskolnikov continued descending the stair-\\ncase in silence.\\n‘Hey, there! Where are you living?’\\nNo answer.\\n‘Well, confound you then!’\\nBut Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street. On \\nthe Nikolaevsky Bridge he was roused to full consciousness \\nagain by an unpleasant incident. A coachman, after shout-\\ning at him two or three times, gave him a violent lash on \\nthe back with his whip, for having almost fallen under his \\nhorses’ hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed \\naway to the railing (for some unknown reason he had been \\nwalking in the very middle of the bridge in the traffic). He \\nangrily clenched and ground his teeth. He heard laughter, \\nof course.\\n‘Serves him right!’\\n‘A pickpocket I dare say.’\\n‘Pretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the \\nwheels on purpose; and you have to answer for him.’\\n‘It’s a regular profession, that’s what it is.’\\nBut while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and \\nbewildered after the retreating carriage, and rubbing his \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf649\\uf64b\\nback, he suddenly felt someone thrust money into his hand. \\nHe looked. It was an elderly woman in a kerchief and goat-\\nskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter wearing a hat, \\nand carrying a green parasol.\\n‘Take it, my good man, in Christ’s name.’\\nHe took it and they passed on. It was a piece of twenty \\ncopecks. From his dress and appearance they might well \\nhave taken him for a beggar asking alms in the streets, and \\nthe gift of the twenty copecks he doubtless owed to the blow, \\nwhich made them feel sorry for him.\\nHe closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for \\nten paces, and turned facing the Neva, looking towards the \\npalace. The sky was without a cloud and the water was al-\\nmost bright blue, which is so rare in the Neva. The cupola of \\nthe cathedral, which is seen at its best from the bridge about \\ntwenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight, and \\nin the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distin-\\nguished.',\n",
              " 'The pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov \\nforgot about it; one uneasy and not quite definite idea occu-\\npied him now completely. He stood still, and gazed long and \\nintently into the distance; this spot was especially familiar \\nto him. When he was attending the university, he had hun-\\ndreds of times—generally on his way home—stood still on \\nthis spot, gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and al-\\nmost always marvelled at a vague and mysterious emotion \\nit roused in him. It left him strangely cold; this gorgeous \\npicture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered every \\ntime at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrust-\\ning himself, put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly \\n1\\uf649\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nrecalled those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to \\nhim that it was no mere chance that he recalled them now. \\nIt struck him as strange and grotesque, that he should have \\nstopped at the same spot as before, as though he actually \\nimagined he could think the same thoughts, be interested \\nin the same theories and pictures that had interested him \\n… so short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it \\nwrung his heart. Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all \\nthat seemed to him now—all his old past, his old thoughts, \\nhis old problems and theories, his old impressions and that \\npicture and himself and all, all…. He felt as though he were \\nflying upwards, and everything were vanishing from his \\nsight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he \\nsuddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He \\nopened his hand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his \\narm flung it into the water; then he turned and went home. \\nIt seemed to him, he had cut himself off from everyone and \\nfrom everything at that moment.\\nEvening was coming on when he reached home, so that \\nhe must have been walking about six hours. How and where \\nhe came back he did not remember. Undressing, and quiver-\\ning like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the sofa, drew \\nhis greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion….\\nIt was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. \\nGood God, what a scream! Such unnatural sounds, such \\nhowling, wailing, grinding, tears, blows and curses he had \\nnever heard.\\nHe could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy. \\nIn terror he sat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf64a0\\nthe fighting, wailing and cursing grew louder and louder. \\nAnd then to his intense amazement he caught the voice of \\nhis landlady. She was howling, shrieking and wailing, rap-\\nidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make out \\nwhat she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, \\nnot to be beaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on \\nthe stairs. The voice of her assailant was so horrible from \\nspite and rage that it was almost a croak; but he, too, was \\nsaying something, and just as quickly and indistinctly, hur-\\nrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov trembled; he \\nrecognised the voice—it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch. Ilya \\nPetrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her, \\nbanging her head against the steps—that’s clear, that can \\nbe told from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How \\nis it, is the world topsy-turvy? He could hear people run-\\nning in crowds from all the storeys and all the staircases; he \\nheard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors banging. ‘But \\nwhy, why, and how could it be?’ he repeated, thinking seri-\\nously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! \\nAnd they would come to him then next, ‘for no doubt … it’s \\nall about that … about yesterday….

I was not asleep … I was sitting up,’ \\nhe said still more timidly. ‘I listened a long while. The as-\\nsistant superintendent came….

He remembered a great \\ndeal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed as though there were \\na number of people round him; they wanted to take him \\naway somewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and \\ndiscussing about him. Then he would be alone in the room; \\nthey had all gone away afraid of him, and only now and \\nthen opened the door a crack to look at him; they threatened \\nhim, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked at \\nhim. He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he dis-\\ntinguished another person, too, whom he seemed to know \\nvery well, though he could not remember who he was, and \\nthis fretted him, even made him cry. Sometimes he fancied \\nhe had been lying there a month; at other times it all seemed \\npart of the same day. But of that—of that he had no recol-\\nlection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten \\nsomething he ought to remember. He worried and torment-\\ned himself trying to remember, moaned, flew into a rage, \\nor sank into awful, intolerable terror. Then he struggled to \\nget up, would have run away, but someone always prevented \\nhim by force, and he sank back into impotence and forget-\\nfulness.',\n",

He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full, \\nshort- waisted coat, and looked like a messenger. The land-\\nlady was peeping in at the half-opened door. Raskolnikov \\nsat up.\\n‘Who is this, Nastasya?’ he asked, pointing to the young \\nman.\\n‘I say, he’s himself again!’ she said.\\n‘He is himself,’ echoed the man.\\nConcluding that he had returned to his senses, the land-\\nlady closed the door and disappeared. She was always shy \\nand dreaded conversations or discussions. She was a wom-\\nan of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat and buxom, with black \\neyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and laziness, \\nand absurdly bashful.\\n‘Who … are you?’ he went on, addressing the man. But at \\nthat moment the door was flung open, and, stooping a little, \\nas he was so tall, Razumihin came in.\\n‘What a cabin it is!’ he cried. ‘I am always knocking my \\nhead. You call this a lodging! So you are conscious, brother? \\nI’ve just heard the news from Pashenka.’\\n‘He has just come to,’ said Nastasya.\\n‘Just come to,’ echoed the man again, with a smile.\\n‘And who are you?’ Razumihin asked, suddenly ad-\\ndressing him. ‘My name is Vrazumihin, at your service; \\nnot Razumihin, as I am always called, but Vrazumihin, a \\n1\\uf64a\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nstudent and gentleman; and he is my friend. And who are \\nyou?’\\n‘I am the messenger from our office, from the merchant \\nShelopaev, and I’ve come on business.’\\n‘Please sit down.’ Razumihin seated himself on the other \\nside of the table. ‘It’s a good thing you’ve come to, broth-\\ner,’ he went on to Raskolnikov. ‘For the last four days you \\nhave scarcely eaten or drunk anything. We had to give you \\ntea in spoonfuls. I brought Zossimov to see you twice. You \\nremember Zossimov? He examined you carefully and said \\nat once it was nothing serious—something seemed to have \\ngone to your head. Some nervous nonsense, the result of \\nbad feeding, he says you have not had enough beer and rad-\\nish, but it’s nothing much, it will pass and you will be all \\nright. Zossimov is a first-rate fellow! He is making quite a \\nname. Come, I won’t keep you,’ he said, addressing the man \\nagain. ‘Will you explain what you want? You must know, \\nRodya, this is the second time they have sent from the office; \\nbut it was another man last time, and I talked to him. Who \\nwas it came before?’\\n‘That was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you \\nplease, sir. That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he is in our of-\\nfice, too.’\\n‘He was more intelligent than you, don’t you think so?’\\n‘Yes, indeed, sir, he is of more weight than I am.’\\n‘Quite so; go on.’\\n‘At your mamma’s request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch \\nVahrushin, of whom I presume you have heard more than \\nonce, a remittance is sent to you from our office,’ the man \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf64a\\uf649\\nbegan, addressing Raskolnikov.',\n",

Do you know him, sir?’\\n‘Yes, I remember … Vahrushin,’ Raskolnikov said dream-\\nily.\\n‘You hear, he knows Vahrushin,’ cried Razumihin. ‘He \\nis in ‘an intelligible condition’! And I see you are an intel-\\nligent man too. Well, it’s always pleasant to hear words of \\nwisdom.’\\n‘That’s the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch. \\nAnd at the request of your mamma, who has sent you a \\nremittance once before in the same manner through him, \\nhe did not refuse this time also, and sent instructions to \\nSemyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you thirty-\\nfive roubles in the hope of better to come.’\\n‘That ‘hoping for better to come’ is the best thing you’ve \\nsaid, though ‘your mamma’ is not bad either. Come then, \\nwhat do you say? Is he fully conscious, eh?’\\n‘That’s all right. If only he can sign this little paper.’\\n‘He can scrawl his name. Have you got the book?’\\n‘Yes, here’s the book.’\\n‘Give it to me. Here, Rodya, sit up. I’ll hold you. Take the \\npen and scribble ‘Raskolnikov’ for him. For just now, broth-\\ner, money is sweeter to us than treacle.’\\n‘I don’t want it,’ said Raskolnikov, pushing away the pen.\\n‘Not want it?’\\n‘I won’t sign it.’\\n1\\uf64a\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘How the devil can you do without signing it?’\\n‘I don’t want … the money.’\\n‘Don’t want the money! Come, brother, that’s nonsense, \\nI bear witness. Don’t trouble, please, it’s only that he is on \\nhis travels again. But that’s pretty common with him at all \\ntimes though…. You are a man of judgment and we will \\ntake him in hand, that is, more simply, take his hand and he \\nwill sign it. Here.’\\n‘But I can come another time.’\\n‘No, no. Why should we trouble you? You are a man of \\njudgment…. Now, Rodya, don’t keep your visitor, you see \\nhe is waiting,’ and he made ready to hold Raskolnikov’s \\nhand in earnest.\\n‘Stop, I’ll do it alone,’ said the latter, taking the pen and \\nsigning his name.\\nThe messenger took out the money and went away.\\n‘Bravo! And now, brother, are you hungry?’\\n‘Yes,’ answered Raskolnikov.\\n‘Is there any soup?’\\n‘Some of yesterday’s,’ answered Nastasya, who was still \\nstanding there.\\n‘With potatoes and rice in it?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘I know it by heart. Bring soup and give us some tea.’\\n‘Very well.’\\nRaskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonish-\\nment and a dull, unreasoning terror.

I believe it’s reality,’ he thought.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf64a\\uf64b\\nIn a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup, \\nand announced that the tea would be ready directly. With \\nthe soup she brought two spoons, two plates, salt, pepper, \\nmustard for the beef, and so on. The table was set as it had \\nnot been for a long time. The cloth was clean.\\n‘It would not be amiss, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlov-\\nna were to send us up a couple of bottles of beer. We could \\nempty them.’\\n‘Well, you are a cool hand,’ muttered Nastasya, and she \\ndeparted to carry out his orders.\\nRaskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention. \\nMeanwhile Razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as \\nclumsily as a bear put his left arm round Raskolnikov’s head, \\nalthough he was able to sit up, and with his right hand gave \\nhim a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that it might not burn \\nhim. But the soup was only just warm. Raskolnikov swal-\\nlowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third. \\nBut after giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, Razumi-\\nhin suddenly stopped, and said that he must ask Zossimov \\nwhether he ought to have more.\\nNastasya came in with two bottles of beer.\\n‘And will you have tea?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘Cut along, Nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may \\nventure on without the faculty. But here is the beer!’ He \\nmoved back to his chair, pulled the soup and meat in front \\nof him, and began eating as though he had not touched food \\nfor three days.\\n‘I must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day \\n1\\uf64a\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nnow,’ he mumbled with his mouth full of beef, ‘and it’s all \\nPashenka, your dear little landlady, who sees to that; she \\nloves to do anything for me. I don’t ask for it, but, of course, \\nI don’t object. And here’s Nastasya with the tea. She is a \\nquick girl. Nastasya, my dear, won’t you have some beer?’\\n‘Get along with your nonsense!’\\n‘A cup of tea, then?’\\n‘A cup of tea, maybe.’\\n‘Pour it out. Stay, I’ll pour it out myself. Sit down.’\\nHe poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the \\nsofa again. As before, he put his left arm round the sick \\nman’s head, raised him up and gave him tea in spoon-\\nfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and earnestly, \\nas though this process was the principal and most effec-\\ntive means towards his friend’s recovery. Raskolnikov said \\nnothing and made no resistance, though he felt quite strong \\nenough to sit up on the sofa without support and could not \\nmerely have held a cup or a spoon, but even perhaps could \\nhave walked about. But from some queer, almost animal, \\ncunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and \\nlying low for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet \\nin full possession of his faculties, and meanwhile listening \\nto find out what was going on. Yet he could not overcome \\nhis sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozen spoonfuls of \\ntea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away \\ncapriciously, and sank back on the pillow. There were actu-\\nally real pillows under his head now, down pillows in clean \\ncases, he observed that, too, and took note of it.\\n‘Pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf64b0\\nmake him some raspberry tea,’ said Razumihin, going back \\nto his chair and attacking his soup and beer again.\\n‘And where is she to get raspberries for you?’ asked Nas-\\ntasya, balancing a saucer on her five outspread fingers and \\nsipping tea through a lump of sugar.\\n‘She’ll get it at the shop, my dear. You see, Rodya, all sorts \\nof things have been happening while you have been laid up. \\nWhen you decamped in that rascally way without leaving \\nyour address, I felt so angry that I resolved to find you out \\nand punish you.

I \\nkept trying to find that Harlamov’s house, and afterwards \\nit turned out that it was not Harlamov’s, but Buch’s. How \\none muddles up sound sometimes!

But as soon \\nas I did land on this place, I soon got to know all your af-\\nfairs—all, all, brother, I know everything; Nastasya here \\nwill tell you. I made the acquaintance of Nikodim Fomitch \\nand Ilya Petrovitch, and the house- porter and Mr. Zame-\\ntov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police \\noffice, and, last, but not least, of Pashenka; Nastasya here \\n1\\uf64b1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nknows….’\\n‘He’s got round her,’ Nastasya murmured, smiling slyly.\\n‘Why don’t you put the sugar in your tea, Nastasya Ni-\\nkiforovna?’\\n‘You are a one!’ Nastasya cried suddenly, going off into a \\ngiggle. ‘I am not Nikiforovna, but Petrovna,’ she added sud-\\ndenly, recovering from her mirth.\\n‘I’ll make a note of it. Well, brother, to make a long story \\nshort, I was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot \\nall malignant influences in the locality, but Pashenka won \\nthe day. I had not expected, brother, to find her so … pre-\\npossessing. Eh, what do you think?’\\nRaskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed \\nupon him, full of alarm.\\n‘And all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect,’ \\nRazumihin went on, not at all embarrassed by his silence.\\n‘Ah, the sly dog!’ Nastasya shrieked again. This conversa-\\ntion afforded her unspeakable delight.\\n‘It’s a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the \\nright way at first. You ought to have approached her differ-\\nently. She is, so to speak, a most unaccountable character. \\nBut we will talk about her character later…. How could \\nyou let things come to such a pass that she gave up send-\\ning you your dinner? And that I O U? You must have been \\nmad to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when \\nher daughter, Natalya Yegorovna, was alive? … I know all \\nabout it! But I see that’s a delicate matter and I am an ass; \\nforgive me. But, talking of foolishness, do you know Pras-\\nkovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as you would think \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf64b\\uf645\\nat first sight?’\\n‘No,’ mumbled Raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling \\nthat it was better to keep up the conversation.\\n‘She isn’t, is she?’ cried Razumihin, delighted to get an \\nanswer out of him. ‘But she is not very clever either, eh? She \\nis essentially, essentially an unaccountable character! I am \\nsometimes quite at a loss, I assure you…. She must be forty; \\nshe says she is thirty- six, and of course she has every right \\nto say so. But I swear I judge her intellectually, simply from \\nthe metaphysical point of view; there is a sort of symbol-\\nism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not! I \\ndon’t understand it! Well, that’s all nonsense. Only, seeing \\nthat you are not a student now and have lost your lessons \\nand your clothes, and that through the young lady’s death \\nshe has no need to treat you as a relation, she suddenly took \\nfright; and as you hid in your den and dropped all your old \\nrelations with her, she planned to get rid of you. And she’s \\nbeen cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to \\nlose the I O U, for you assured her yourself that your mother \\nwould pay.’\\n‘It was base of me to say that…. My mother herself is al-\\nmost a beggar … and I told a lie to keep my lodging … and \\nbe fed,’ Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly.\\n‘Yes, you did very sensibly. But the worst of it is that at \\nthat point Mr. Tchebarov turns up, a business man. Pash-\\nenka would never have thought of doing anything on her \\nown account, she is too retiring; but the business man is \\nby no means retiring, and first thing he puts the question, \\n‘Is there any hope of realising the I O U?’ Answer: there is, \\n1\\uf64b\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nbecause he has a mother who would save her Rodya with \\nher hundred and twenty-five roubles pension, if she has to \\nstarve herself; and a sister, too, who would go into bondage \\nfor his sake.

But I tell you what it is; an hon-\\nest and sensitive man is open; and a business man ‘listens \\nand goes on eating’ you up. Well, then she gave the I O U by \\nway of payment to this Tchebarov, and without hesitation \\nhe made a formal demand for payment. When I heard of all \\nthis I wanted to blow him up, too, to clear my conscience, \\nbut by that time harmony reigned between me and Pash-\\nenka, and I insisted on stopping the whole affair, engaging \\nthat you would pay.

Don’t worry yourself; you said nothing about a \\ncountess. But you said a lot about a bulldog, and about ear-\\nrings and chains, and about Krestovsky Island, and some \\nporter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, the assis-\\ntant superintendent. And another thing that was of special \\ninterest to you was your own sock.

And only then were you comforted, and \\nfor the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched thing \\nin your hand; we could not get it from you.

No \\none had looked, then! Then he remembered the sock about \\nwhich Razumihin had just been telling him.

Give me the parcel, Nas-\\ntasya. We will open it directly. And how do you feel now, \\nbrother?’\\n‘I am quite well, I am not ill. Razumihin, have you been \\nhere long?’\\n‘I tell you I’ve been waiting for the last three hours.’\\n‘No, before.’\\n‘How do you mean?’\\n‘How long have you been coming here?’\\n‘Why I told you all about it this morning. Don’t you re-\\nmember?’\\nRaskolnikov pondered. The morning seemed like a \\ndream to him. He could not remember alone, and looked \\ninquiringly at Razumihin.\\n‘Hm!’ said the latter, ‘he has forgotten. I fancied then that \\nyou were not quite yourself. Now you are better for your \\nsleep…. You really look much better. First-rate! Well, to \\nbusiness. Look here, my dear boy.’\\n1\\uf64b\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nHe began untying the bundle, which evidently interested \\nhim.\\n‘Believe me, brother, this is something specially near my \\nheart. For we must make a man of you. Let’s begin from the \\ntop. Do you see this cap?’ he said, taking out of the bundle \\na fairly good though cheap and ordinary cap. ‘Let me try it \\non.’\\n‘Presently, afterwards,’ said Raskolnikov, waving it off \\npettishly.\\n‘Come, Rodya, my boy, don’t oppose it, afterwards will be \\ntoo late; and I shan’t sleep all night, for I bought it by guess, \\nwithout measure. Just right!’ he cried triumphantly, fitting it \\non, ‘just your size! A proper head-covering is the first thing \\nin dress and a recommendation in its own way. Tolstyakov, \\na friend of mine, is always obliged to take off his pudding \\nbasin when he goes into any public place where other peo-\\nple wear their hats or caps. People think he does it from \\nslavish politeness, but it’s simply because he is ashamed of \\nhis bird’s nest; he is such a boastful fellow! Look, Nastasya, \\nhere are two specimens of headgear: this Palmerston’—he \\ntook from the corner Raskolnikov’s old, battered hat, which \\nfor some unknown reason, he called a Palmerston—‘or this \\njewel! Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid \\nfor it, Nastasya!’ he said, turning to her, seeing that Raskol-\\nnikov did not speak.\\n‘Twenty copecks, no more, I dare say,’ answered Nasta-\\nsya.\\n‘Twenty copecks, silly!’ he cried, offended. ‘Why, nowa-\\ndays you would cost more than that—eighty copecks! And \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf64c0\\nthat only because it has been worn. And it’s bought on con-\\ndition that when’s it’s worn out, they will give you another \\nnext year. Yes, on my word! Well, now let us pass to the \\nUnited States of America, as they called them at school. I \\nassure you I am proud of these breeches,’ and he exhibit-\\ned to Raskolnikov a pair of light, summer trousers of grey \\nwoollen material. ‘No holes, no spots, and quite respectable, \\nalthough a little worn; and a waistcoat to match, quite in \\nthe fashion. And its being worn really is an improvement, \\nit’s softer, smoother…. You see, Rodya, to my thinking, the \\ngreat thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to \\nthe seasons; if you don’t insist on having asparagus in Janu-\\nary, you keep your money in your purse; and it’s the same \\nwith this purchase.',\n",

What do you say? Two roubles twen-\\nty-five copecks! And remember the condition: if you wear \\nthese out, you will have another suit for nothing! They only \\ndo business on that system at Fedyaev’s; if you’ve bought a \\nthing once, you are satisfied for life, for you will never go \\nthere again of your own free will. Now for the boots. What \\ndo you say? You see that they are a bit worn, but they’ll last \\na couple of months, for it’s foreign work and foreign leather; \\nthe secretary of the English Embassy sold them last week—\\nhe had only worn them six days, but he was very short of \\ncash. Price—a rouble and a half. A bargain?’\\n1\\uf64c1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘But perhaps they won’t fit,’ observed Nastasya.\\n‘Not fit? Just look!’ and he pulled out of his pocket Raskol-\\nnikov’s old, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud. ‘I did \\nnot go empty- handed—they took the size from this mon-\\nster. We all did our best. And as to your linen, your landlady \\nhas seen to that. Here, to begin with are three shirts, hemp-\\nen but with a fashionable front…. Well now then, eighty \\ncopecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks the suit—\\ntogether three roubles five copecks—a rouble and a half \\nfor the boots—for, you see, they are very good—and that \\nmakes four roubles fifty-five copecks; five roubles for the \\nunderclothes—they were bought in the lo— which makes \\nexactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks. Forty-five copecks \\nchange in coppers. Will you take it? And so, Rodya, you are \\nset up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will \\nserve, and even has a style of its own. That comes from get-\\nting one’s clothes from Sharmer’s! As for your socks and \\nother things, I leave them to you; we’ve twenty-five roubles \\nleft. And as for Pashenka and paying for your lodging, don’t \\nyou worry. I tell you she’ll trust you for anything. And now, \\nbrother, let me change your linen, for I daresay you will \\nthrow off your illness with your shirt.’\\n‘Let me be! I don’t want to!’ Raskolnikov waved him off. \\nHe had listened with disgust to Razumihin’s efforts to be \\nplayful about his purchases.\\n‘Come, brother, don’t tell me I’ve been trudging around \\nfor nothing,’ Razumihin insisted. ‘Nastasya, don’t be bash-\\nful, but help me—that’s it,’ and in spite of Raskolnikov’s \\nresistance he changed his linen. The latter sank back on the \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf64c\\uf645\\npillows and for a minute or two said nothing.\\n‘It will be long before I get rid of them,’ he thought. ‘What \\nmoney was all that bought with?’ he asked at last, gazing at \\nthe wall.\\n‘Money? Why, your own, what the messenger brought \\nfrom Vahrushin, your mother sent it. Have you forgotten \\nthat, too?’\\n‘I remember now,’ said Raskolnikov after a long, sullen \\nsilence. Razumihin looked at him, frowning and uneasy.\\nThe door opened and a tall, stout man whose appearance \\nseemed familiar to Raskolnikov came in.\\n1\\uf64c\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter IV\\nZ\\nossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-\\nshaven face and straight flaxen hair. He wore spectacles, \\nand a big gold ring on his fat finger. He was twenty-seven. \\nHe had on a light grey fashionable loose coat, light sum-\\nmer trousers, and everything about him loose, fashionable \\nand spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his watch-\\nchain was massive. In manner he was slow and, as it were, \\nnonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; \\nhe made efforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was \\napparent at every instant. All his acquaintances found him \\ntedious, but said he was clever at his work.\\n‘I’ve been to you twice to-day, brother. You see, he’s come \\nto himself,’ cried Razumihin.\\n‘I see, I see; and how do we feel now, eh?’ said Zossimov \\nto Raskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down \\nat the foot of the sofa, he settled himself as comfortably as \\nhe could.',\n",
              " '‘He is still depressed,’ Razumihin went on. ‘We’ve just \\nchanged his linen and he almost cried.’\\n‘That’s very natural; you might have put it off if he did \\nnot wish it…. His pulse is first-rate. Is your head still ach-\\ning, eh?’\\n‘I am well, I am perfectly well!’ Raskolnikov declared \\npositively and irritably. He raised himself on the sofa and \\nCrime and Punishment\\n1\\uf64c\\uf647\\nlooked at them with glittering eyes, but sank back on to the \\npillow at once and turned to the wall. Zossimov watched \\nhim intently.\\n‘Very good…. Going on all right,’ he said lazily. ‘Has he \\neaten anything?’\\nThey told him, and asked what he might have.\\n‘He may have anything … soup, tea … mushrooms and \\ncucumbers, of course, you must not give him; he’d better \\nnot have meat either, and … but no need to tell you that!’ \\nRazumihin and he looked at each other. ‘No more medicine \\nor anything. I’ll look at him again to-morrow. Perhaps, to-\\nday even … but never mind …’\\n‘To-morrow evening I shall take him for a walk,’ said Ra-\\nzumihin. ‘We are going to the Yusupov garden and then to \\nthe Palais de Crystal.’\\n‘I would not disturb him to-morrow at all, but I don’t \\nknow … a little, maybe … but we’ll see.’\\n‘Ach, what a nuisance! I’ve got a house-warming party \\nto-night; it’s only a step from here. Couldn’t he come? He \\ncould lie on the sofa. You are coming?’ Razumihin said to \\nZossimov. ‘Don’t forget, you promised.’\\n‘All right, only rather later. What are you going to do?’\\n‘Oh, nothing—tea, vodka, herrings. There will be a pie … \\njust our friends.’\\n‘And who?’\\n‘All neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my \\nold uncle, and he is new too—he only arrived in Petersburg \\nyesterday to see to some business of his.

Well, there will be some students, a \\nteacher, a government clerk, a musician, an officer and Za-\\nmetov.’\\n‘Do tell me, please, what you or he’—Zossimov nodded at \\nRaskolnikov— ‘can have in common with this Zametov?’\\n‘Oh, you particular gentleman! Principles! You are \\nworked by principles, as it were by springs; you won’t ven-\\nture to turn round on your own account. If a man is a nice \\nfellow, that’s the only principle I go upon.

She \\nused to come here.

He felt his arms and legs as lifeless as \\nthough they had been cut off. He did not attempt to move, \\nbut stared obstinately at the flower.\\n‘But what about the painter?’ Zossimov interrupted Nas-\\ntasya’s chatter with marked displeasure. She sighed and was \\nsilent.\\n‘Why, he was accused of the murder,’ Razumihin went \\non hotly.\\n‘Was there evidence against him then?’\\n‘Evidence, indeed! Evidence that was no evidence, and \\nthat’s what we have to prove. It was just as they pitched on \\nthose fellows, Koch and Pestryakov, at first. Foo! how stu-\\npidly it’s all done, it makes one sick, though it’s not one’s \\nbusiness! Pestryakov may be coming to-night…. By the \\nway, Rodya, you’ve heard about the business already; it hap-\\npened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at the \\npolice office while they were talking about it.’\\nZossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov. He did not \\nstir.\\n‘But I say, Razumihin, I wonder at you.

Eh! \\nDo you know the details of the case?’\\n‘I am waiting to hear about the painter.’\\n‘Oh, yes! Well, here’s the story. Early on the third day after \\nthe murder, when they were still dandling Koch and Pes-\\ntryakov—though they accounted for every step they took \\nand it was as plain as a pikestaff- an unexpected fact turned \\nup. A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a dram-shop fac-\\ning the house, brought to the police office a jeweller’s case \\ncontaining some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole. \\n‘The day before yesterday, just after eight o’clock’—mark the \\nday and the hour!—‘a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, \\nwho had been in to see me already that day, brought me \\nthis box of gold ear-rings and stones, and asked me to give \\n1\\uf64c\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nhim two roubles for them. When I asked him where he got \\nthem, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not \\nask him anything more.’ I am telling you Dushkin’s story. \\n‘I gave him a note’—a rouble that is—‘for I thought if he \\ndid not pawn it with me he would with another. It would \\nall come to the same thing—he’d spend it on drink, so the \\nthing had better be with me. The further you hide it the \\nquicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear \\nany rumours, I’ll take it to the police.’ Of course, that’s all \\ntaradiddle; he lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, \\nhe is a pawnbroker and a receiver of stolen goods, and he \\ndid not cheat Nikolay out of a thirty-rouble trinket in or-\\nder to give it to the police. He was simply afraid. But no \\nmatter, to return to Dushkin’s story. ‘I’ve known this peas-\\nant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the \\nsame province and district of Zaraïsk, we are both Ryazan \\nmen. And though Nikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and \\nI knew he had a job in that house, painting work with Dmi-\\ntri, who comes from the same village, too. As soon as he \\ngot the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses, took \\nhis change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him \\nthen. And the next day I heard that someone had murdered \\nAlyona Ivanovna and her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with \\nan axe. I knew them, and I felt suspicious about the ear-\\nrings at once, for I knew the murdered woman lent money \\non pledges. I went to the house, and began to make care-\\nful inquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all \\nI asked, ‘Is Nikolay here?’ Dmitri told me that Nikolay had \\ngone off on the spree; he had come home at daybreak drunk, \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64500\\nstayed in the house about ten minutes, and went out again. \\nDmitri didn’t see him again and is finishing the job alone. \\nAnd their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on the \\nsecond floor. When I heard all that I did not say a word \\nto anyone’—that’s Dushkin’s tale—‘but I found out what I \\ncould about the murder, and went home feeling as suspi-\\ncious as ever. And at eight o’clock this morning’— that was \\nthe third day, you understand—‘I saw Nikolay coming in, \\nnot sober, though not to say very drunk—he could under-\\nstand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and \\ndid not speak.',\n",
              " 'There was only one stranger in the bar and a \\nman I knew asleep on a bench and our two boys. ‘Have you \\nseen Dmitri?’ said I. ‘No, I haven’t,’ said he. ‘And you’ve not \\nbeen here either?’ ‘Not since the day before yesterday,’ said \\nhe. ‘And where did you sleep last night?’ ‘In Peski, with the \\nKolomensky men.’ ‘And where did you get those ear-rings?’ \\nI asked. ‘I found them in the street,’ and the way he said it \\nwas a bit queer; he did not look at me. ‘Did you hear what \\nhappened that very evening, at that very hour, on that same \\nstaircase?’ said I. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I had not heard,’ and all the \\nwhile he was listening, his eyes were staring out of his head \\nand he turned as white as chalk. I told him all about it and \\nhe took his hat and began getting up. I wanted to keep him. \\n‘Wait a bit, Nikolay,’ said I, ‘won’t you have a drink?’ And I \\nsigned to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from be-\\nhind the bar; but he darted out and down the street to the \\nturning at a run. I have not seen him since. Then my doubts \\nwere at an end—it was his doing, as clear as could be….’’\\n‘I should think so,’ said Zossimov.\\n\\uf64501\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘Wait! Hear the end. Of course they sought high and low \\nfor Nikolay; they detained Dushkin and searched his house; \\nDmitri, too, was arrested; the Kolomensky men also were \\nturned inside out. And the day before yesterday they ar-\\nrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. He had \\ngone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for \\na dram for it. They gave it to him. A few minutes afterwards \\nthe woman went to the cowshed, and through a crack in the \\nwall she saw in the stable adjoining he had made a noose of \\nhis sash from the beam, stood on a block of wood, and was \\ntrying to put his neck in the noose. The woman screeched \\nher hardest; people ran in. ‘So that’s what you are up to!’ \\n‘Take me,’ he says, ‘to such-and-such a police officer; I’ll \\nconfess everything.’ Well, they took him to that police sta-\\ntion— that is here—with a suitable escort. So they asked \\nhim this and that, how old he is, ‘twenty-two,’ and so on. At \\nthe question, ‘When you were working with Dmitri, didn’t \\nyou see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a time?’—\\nanswer: ‘To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but \\nI did not notice them.’ ‘And didn’t you hear anything, any \\nnoise, and so on?’ ‘We heard nothing special.’ ‘And did you \\nhear, Nikolay, that on the same day Widow So-and-so and \\nher sister were murdered and robbed?’ ‘I never knew a thing \\nabout it. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy Pavlovitch \\nthe day before yesterday.’ ‘And where did you find the ear-\\nrings?’ ‘I found them on the pavement. ‘Why didn’t you go \\nto work with Dmitri the other day?’ ‘Because I was drink-\\ning.’ ‘And where were you drinking?’ ‘Oh, in such-and-such \\na place.’ ‘Why did you run away from Dushkin’s?’ ‘Because \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6450\\uf645\\nI was awfully frightened.’ ‘What were you frightened of?’ \\n‘That I should be accused.’ ‘How could you be frightened, if \\nyou felt free from guilt?’ Now, Zossimov, you may not be-\\nlieve me, that question was put literally in those words. I \\nknow it for a fact, it was repeated to me exactly! What do \\nyou say to that?’\\n‘Well, anyway, there’s the evidence.’\\n‘I am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about \\nthat question, of their own idea of themselves. Well, so they \\nsqueezed and squeezed him and he confessed: ‘I did not \\nfind it in the street, but in the flat where I was painting with \\nDmitri.’ ‘And how was that?’ ‘Why, Dmitri and I were paint-\\ning there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, and \\nDmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he ran off \\nand I after him.',\n",
              " 'I ran after him, shouting my hardest, and \\nat the bottom of the stairs I ran right against the porter and \\nsome gentlemen—and how many gentlemen were there I \\ndon’t remember.

I got hold of Dmitri’s hair and knocked him down and \\nbegan beating him. And Dmitri, too, caught me by the hair \\nand began beating me.

He told a \\nlie saying he found them in the street, and went off drink-\\ning. He keeps repeating his old story about the murder: ‘I \\nknow nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yes-\\nterday.’ ‘And why didn’t you come to the police till now?’ \\n‘I was frightened.’ ‘And why did you try to hang yourself?’ \\n‘From anxiety.’ ‘What anxiety?’ ‘That I should be accused of \\nit.’ Well, that’s the whole story. And now what do you sup-\\npose they deduced from that?’\\n‘Why, there’s no supposing. There’s a clue, such as it is, a \\nfact.

You are excited. But what about the \\near-rings? You must admit that, if on the very same day \\nand hour ear-rings from the old woman’s box have come \\ninto Nikolay’s hands, they must have come there somehow. \\nThat’s a good deal in such a case.’\\n‘How did they get there? How did they get there?’ cried \\nRazumihin. ‘How can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to \\nstudy man and who has more opportunity than anyone else \\nfor studying human nature—how can you fail to see the \\ncharacter of the man in the whole story? Don’t you see at \\nonce that the answers he has given in the examination are \\nthe holy truth?

They’d just killed them, not five \\nor ten minutes before, for the bodies were still warm, and at \\nonce, leaving the flat open, knowing that people would go \\nthere at once, flinging away their booty, they rolled about \\nlike children, laughing and attracting general attention. \\nAnd there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that!’\\n‘Of course it is strange!

And do you suppose, from the character of our \\nlegal system, that they will accept, or that they are in a posi-\\ntion to accept, this fact— resting simply on a psychological \\nimpossibility—as irrefutable and conclusively breaking \\ndown the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution? No, \\nthey won’t accept it, they certainly won’t, because they found \\nthe jewel-case and the man tried to hang himself, ‘which he \\ncould not have done if he hadn’t felt guilty.’ That’s the point, \\nthat’s what excites me, you must understand!’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6450\\uf649\\n‘Oh, I see you are excited! Wait a bit. I forgot to ask you; \\nwhat proof is there that the box came from the old wom-\\nan?’\\n‘That’s been proved,’ said Razumihin with apparent re-\\nluctance, frowning. ‘Koch recognised the jewel-case and \\ngave the name of the owner, who proved conclusively that \\nit was his.’\\n‘That’s bad. Now another point. Did anyone see Nikolay \\nat the time that Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at \\nfirst, and is there no evidence about that?’\\n‘Nobody did see him,’ Razumihin answered with vexa-\\ntion. ‘That’s the worst of it. Even Koch and Pestryakov did \\nnot notice them on their way upstairs, though, indeed, their \\nevidence could not have been worth much. They said they \\nsaw the flat was open, and that there must be work going on \\nin it, but they took no special notice and could not remem-\\nber whether there actually were men at work in it.’\\n‘Hm! … So the only evidence for the defence is that they \\nwere beating one another and laughing. That constitutes a \\nstrong presumption, but … How do you explain the facts \\nyourself?’\\n‘How do I explain them? What is there to explain? It’s \\nclear. At any rate, the direction in which explanation is to \\nbe sought is clear, and the jewel-case points to it. The real \\nmurderer dropped those ear- rings. The murderer was up-\\nstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked at the \\ndoor. Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the mur-\\nderer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other \\nway of escape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the por-\\n\\uf6450\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nter in the flat when Nikolay and Dmitri had just run out of \\nit. He stopped there while the porter and others were go-\\ning upstairs, waited till they were out of hearing, and then \\nwent calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri \\nand Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in \\nthe entry; possibly he was seen, but not noticed. There are \\nlots of people going in and out. He must have dropped the \\near-rings out of his pocket when he stood behind the door, \\nand did not notice he dropped them, because he had other \\nthings to think of. The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that \\nhe did stand there…. That’s how I explain it.’\\n‘Too clever! No, my boy, you’re too clever. That beats ev-\\nerything.’\\n‘But, why, why?’\\n‘Why, because everything fits too well … it’s too melo-\\ndramatic.’\\n‘A-ach!’ Razumihin was exclaiming, but at that moment \\nthe door opened and a personage came in who was a strang-\\ner to all present.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6450\\uf64b\\nChapter V\\nT\\nhis was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and port-\\nly appearance, and a cautious and sour countenance. He \\nbegan by stopping short in the doorway, staring about him \\nwith offensive and undisguised astonishment, as though \\nasking himself what sort of place he had come to. Mistrust-\\nfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost \\naffronted, he scanned Raskolnikov’s low and narrow ‘cabin.’ \\nWith the same amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who \\nlay undressed, dishevelled, unwashed, on his miserable \\ndirty sofa, looking fixedly at him. Then with the same de-\\nliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and \\nunshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and \\ninquiringly in the face without rising from his seat. A con-\\nstrained silence lasted for a couple of minutes, and then, as \\nmight be expected, some scene-shifting took place. Reflect-\\ning, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs, that \\nhe would get nothing in this ‘cabin’ by attempting to over-\\nawe them, the gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, \\nthough with some severity, emphasising every syllable of \\nhis question, addressed Zossimov:\\n‘Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or former-\\nly a student?’\\nZossimov made a slight movement, and would have an-\\nswered, had not Razumihin anticipated him.\\n\\uf6450\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘Here he is lying on the sofa! What do you want?’\\nThis familiar ‘what do you want’ seemed to cut the \\nground from the feet of the pompous gentleman. He was \\nturning to Razumihin, but checked himself in time and \\nturned to Zossimov again.',\n",
              " '‘This is Raskolnikov,’ mumbled Zossimov, nodding to-\\nwards him. Then he gave a prolonged yawn, opening his \\nmouth as wide as possible. Then he lazily put his hand into \\nhis waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold watch in a \\nround hunter’s case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly \\nand lazily proceeded to put it back.\\nRaskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, \\ngazing persistently, though without understanding, at \\nthe stranger. Now that his face was turned away from the \\nstrange flower on the paper, it was extremely pale and wore \\na look of anguish, as though he had just undergone an ago-\\nnising operation or just been taken from the rack. But the \\nnew-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then \\nhis wonder, then suspicion and even alarm. When Zossi-\\nmov said ‘This is Raskolnikov’ he jumped up quickly, sat on \\nthe sofa and with an almost defiant, but weak and breaking, \\nvoice articulated:\\n‘Yes, I am Raskolnikov! What do you want?’\\nThe visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressive-\\nly:\\n‘Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason to hope \\nthat my name is not wholly unknown to you?’\\nBut Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite dif-\\nferent, gazed blankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64510\\nas though he heard the name of Pyotr Petrovitch for the \\nfirst time.\\n‘Is it possible that you can up to the present have received \\nno information?’ asked Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat discon-\\ncerted.\\nIn reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, \\nput his hands behind his head and gazed at the ceiling. A \\nlook of dismay came into Luzhin’s face. Zossimov and Ra-\\nzumihin stared at him more inquisitively than ever, and at \\nlast he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment.\\n‘I had presumed and calculated,’ he faltered, ‘that a letter \\nposted more than ten days, if not a fortnight ago …’\\n‘I say, why are you standing in the doorway?’ Razumihin \\ninterrupted suddenly. ‘If you’ve something to say, sit down. \\nNastasya and you are so crowded. Nastasya, make room. \\nHere’s a chair, thread your way in!’\\nHe moved his chair back from the table, made a little \\nspace between the table and his knees, and waited in a rath-\\ner cramped position for the visitor to ‘thread his way in.’ \\nThe minute was so chosen that it was impossible to refuse, \\nand the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying and \\nstumbling. Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspi-\\nciously at Razumihin.\\n‘No need to be nervous,’ the latter blurted out. ‘Rodya \\nhas been ill for the last five days and delirious for three, but \\nnow he is recovering and has got an appetite. This is his \\ndoctor, who has just had a look at him. I am a comrade of \\nRodya’s, like him, formerly a student, and now I am nurs-\\ning him; so don’t you take any notice of us, but go on with \\n\\uf64511\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nyour business.’\\n‘Thank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by my \\npresence and conversation?’ Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zos-\\nsimov.\\n‘N-no,’ mumbled Zossimov; ‘you may amuse him.’ He \\nyawned again.\\n‘He has been conscious a long time, since the morning,’ \\nwent on Razumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much \\nlike unaffected good- nature that Pyotr Petrovitch began to \\nbe more cheerful, partly, perhaps, because this shabby and \\nimpudent person had introduced himself as a student.\\n‘Your mamma,’ began Luzhin.\\n‘Hm!’ Razumihin cleared his throat loudly. Luzhin \\nlooked at him inquiringly.\\n‘That’s all right, go on.’\\nLuzhin shrugged his shoulders.\\n‘Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I \\nwas sojourning in her neighbourhood. On my arrival here \\nI purposely allowed a few days to elapse before coming to \\nsee you, in order that I might be fully assured that you were \\nin full possession of the tidings; but now, to my astonish-\\nment …’\\n‘I know, I know!’ Raskolnikov cried suddenly with im-\\npatient vexation. ‘So you are the fiancé? I know, and that’s \\nenough!’\\nThere was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch’s being of-\\nfended this time, but he said nothing. He made a violent \\neffort to understand what it all meant. There was a mo-\\nment’s silence.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6451\\uf645\\nMeanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards \\nhim when he answered, began suddenly staring at him again \\nwith marked curiosity, as though he had not had a good look \\nat him yet, or as though something new had struck him; he \\nrose from his pillow on purpose to stare at him.',\n",
              " 'There cer-\\ntainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch’s whole \\nappearance, something which seemed to justify the title of \\n‘fiancé’ so unceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, \\nit was evident, far too much so indeed, that Pyotr Petro-\\nvitch had made eager use of his few days in the capital to \\nget himself up and rig himself out in expectation of his be-\\ntrothed—a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding, \\nindeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, conscious-\\nness of the agreeable improvement in his appearance might \\nhave been forgiven in such circumstances, seeing that Pyotr \\nPetrovitch had taken up the rôle of fiancé. All his clothes \\nwere fresh from the tailor’s and were all right, except for be-\\ning too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even the stylish \\nnew round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch \\ntreated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his \\nhands. The exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, \\ntold the same tale, if only from the fact of his not wearing \\nthem, but carrying them in his hand for show. Light and \\nyouthful colours predominated in Pyotr Petrovitch’s attire. \\nHe wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade, light \\nthin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a \\ncravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and \\nthe best of it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very \\nfresh and even handsome face looked younger than his for-\\n\\uf6451\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nty-five years at all times. His dark, mutton-chop whiskers \\nmade an agreeable setting on both sides, growing thickly \\nupon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair, touched \\nhere and there with grey, though it had been combed and \\ncurled at a hairdresser’s, did not give him a stupid appear-\\nance, as curled hair usually does, by inevitably suggesting \\na German on his wedding-day. If there really was some-\\nthing unpleasing and repulsive in his rather good-looking \\nand imposing countenance, it was due to quite other causes. \\nAfter scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov \\nsmiled malignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at \\nthe ceiling as before.\\nBut Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to deter-\\nmine to take no notice of their oddities.\\n‘I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation,’ \\nhe began, again breaking the silence with an effort. ‘If I had \\nbeen aware of your illness I should have come earlier. But \\nyou know what business is. I have, too, a very important \\nlegal affair in the Senate, not to mention other preoccupa-\\ntions which you may well conjecture. I am expecting your \\nmamma and sister any minute.’\\nRaskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to \\nspeak; his face showed some excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch \\npaused, waited, but as nothing followed, he went on:\\n‘… Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their \\narrival.’\\n‘Where?’ asked Raskolnikov weakly.\\n‘Very near here, in Bakaleyev’s house.’\\n‘That’s in Voskresensky,’ put in Razumihin. ‘There are \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6451\\uf647\\ntwo storeys of rooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I’ve \\nbeen there.’\\n‘Yes, rooms …’\\n‘A disgusting place—filthy, stinking and, what’s more, of \\ndoubtful character. Things have happened there, and there \\nare all sorts of queer people living there. And I went there \\nabout a scandalous business. It’s cheap, though …’\\n‘I could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am \\na stranger in Petersburg myself,’ Pyotr Petrovitch replied \\nhuffily. ‘However, the two rooms are exceedingly clean, \\nand as it is for so short a time … I have already taken a \\npermanent, that is, our future flat,’ he said, addressing Ras-\\nkolnikov, ‘and I am having it done up. And meanwhile I \\nam myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend \\nAndrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame \\nLippevechsel; it was he who told me of Bakaleyev’s house, \\ntoo …’\\n‘Lebeziatnikov?’ said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling \\nsomething.\\n‘Yes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the \\nMinistry. Do you know him?’\\n‘Yes … no,’ Raskolnikov answered.\\n‘Excuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once his \\nguardian….',\n",
              " 'A very nice young man and advanced. I like to \\nmeet young people: one learns new things from them.’ Lu-\\nzhin looked round hopefully at them all.\\n‘How do you mean?’ asked Razumihin.\\n‘In the most serious and essential matters,’ Pyotr Petro-\\nvitch replied, as though delighted at the question. ‘You see, \\n\\uf6451\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nit’s ten years since I visited Petersburg. All the novelties, re-\\nforms, ideas have reached us in the provinces, but to see \\nit all more clearly one must be in Petersburg. And it’s my \\nnotion that you observe and learn most by watching the \\nyounger generation. And I confess I am delighted …’\\n‘At what?’\\n‘Your question is a wide one. I may be mistaken, but I \\nfancy I find clearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more \\npracticality …’\\n‘That’s true,’ Zossimov let drop.\\n‘Nonsense! There’s no practicality.’ Razumihin flew at \\nhim. ‘Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop \\ndown from heaven. And for the last two hundred years we \\nhave been divorced from all practical life. Ideas, if you like, \\nare fermenting,’ he said to Pyotr Petrovitch, ‘and desire for \\ngood exists, though it’s in a childish form, and honesty you \\nmay find, although there are crowds of brigands. Anyway, \\nthere’s no practicality. Practicality goes well shod.’\\n‘I don’t agree with you,’ Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with ev-\\nident enjoyment. ‘Of course, people do get carried away and \\nmake mistakes, but one must have indulgence; those mis-\\ntakes are merely evidence of enthusiasm for the cause and \\nof abnormal external environment. If little has been done, \\nthe time has been but short; of means I will not speak. It’s \\nmy personal view, if you care to know, that something has \\nbeen accomplished already. New valuable ideas, new valu-\\nable works are circulating in the place of our old dreamy \\nand romantic authors. Literature is taking a maturer form, \\nmany injurious prejudice have been rooted up and turned \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6451\\uf649\\ninto ridicule…. In a word, we have cut ourselves off irre-\\nvocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great \\nthing …’\\n‘He’s learnt it by heart to show off!’ Raskolnikov pro-\\nnounced suddenly.\\n‘What?’ asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his words; \\nbut he received no reply.\\n‘That’s all true,’ Zossimov hastened to interpose.\\n‘Isn’t it so?’ Pyotr Petrovitch went on, glancing affably at \\nZossimov. ‘You must admit,’ he went on, addressing Razu-\\nmihin with a shade of triumph and superciliousness—he \\nalmost added ‘young man’—‘that there is an advance, or, as \\nthey say now, progress in the name of science and economic \\ntruth …’\\n‘A commonplace.’\\n‘No, not a commonplace! Hitherto, for instance, if I were \\ntold, ‘love thy neighbour,’ what came of it?’ Pyotr Petrovitch \\nwent on, perhaps with excessive haste. ‘It came to my tear-\\ning my coat in half to share with my neighbour and we both \\nwere left half naked. As a Russian proverb has it, ‘Catch sev-\\neral hares and you won’t catch one.’ Science now tells us, \\nlove yourself before all men, for everything in the world \\nrests on self-interest. You love yourself and manage your \\nown affairs properly and your coat remains whole. Econom-\\nic truth adds that the better private affairs are organised in \\nsociety—the more whole coats, so to say—the firmer are its \\nfoundations and the better is the common welfare organised \\ntoo. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for \\nmyself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to \\n\\uf6451\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nbring to pass my neighbour’s getting a little more than a \\ntorn coat; and that not from private, personal liberality, but \\nas a consequence of the general advance. The idea is simple, \\nbut unhappily it has been a long time reaching us, being \\nhindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet it would \\nseem to want very little wit to perceive it …’\\n‘Excuse me, I’ve very little wit myself,’ Razumihin cut in \\nsharply, ‘and so let us drop it. I began this discussion with \\nan object, but I’ve grown so sick during the last three years \\nof this chattering to amuse oneself, of this incessant flow \\nof commonplaces, always the same, that, by Jove, I blush \\neven when other people talk like that.',\n",
              " 'You are in a hurry, no \\ndoubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don’t blame you, \\nthat’s quite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what sort \\nof man you are, for so many unscrupulous people have got \\nhold of the progressive cause of late and have so distorted in \\ntheir own interests everything they touched, that the whole \\ncause has been dragged in the mire. That’s enough!’\\n‘Excuse me, sir,’ said Luzhin, affronted, and speaking \\nwith excessive dignity. ‘Do you mean to suggest so uncer-\\nemoniously that I too …’\\n‘Oh, my dear sir … how could I? … Come, that’s enough,’ \\nRazumihin concluded, and he turned abruptly to Zossimov \\nto continue their previous conversation.\\nPyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the dis-\\navowal. He made up his mind to take leave in another \\nminute or two.\\n‘I trust our acquaintance,’ he said, addressing Raskolnikov, \\n‘may, upon your recovery and in view of the circumstances \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6451\\uf64b\\nof which you are aware, become closer … Above all, I hope \\nfor your return to health …’\\nRaskolnikov did not even turn his head. Pyotr Petro-\\nvitch began getting up from his chair.\\n‘One of her customers must have killed her,’ Zossimov \\ndeclared positively.\\n‘Not a doubt of it,’ replied Razumihin. ‘Porfiry doesn’t \\ngive his opinion, but is examining all who have left pledges \\nwith her there.’\\n‘Examining them?’ Raskolnikov asked aloud.\\n‘Yes. What then?’\\n‘Nothing.’\\n‘How does he get hold of them?’ asked Zossimov.\\n‘Koch has given the names of some of them, other names \\nare on the wrappers of the pledges and some have come for-\\nward of themselves.’\\n‘It must have been a cunning and practised ruffian! The \\nboldness of it! The coolness!’\\n‘That’s just what it wasn’t!’ interposed Razumihin. ‘That’s \\nwhat throws you all off the scent. But I maintain that he is \\nnot cunning, not practised, and probably this was his first \\ncrime! The supposition that it was a calculated crime and a \\ncunning criminal doesn’t work. Suppose him to have been \\ninexperienced, and it’s clear that it was only a chance that \\nsaved him—and chance may do anything. Why, he did not \\nforesee obstacles, perhaps! And how did he set to work? He \\ntook jewels worth ten or twenty roubles, stuffing his pockets \\nwith them, ransacked the old woman’s trunks, her rags—\\nand they found fifteen hundred roubles, besides notes, in \\n\\uf6451\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\na box in the top drawer of the chest! He did not know how \\nto rob; he could only murder. It was his first crime, I assure \\nyou, his first crime; he lost his head. And he got off more by \\nluck than good counsel!’\\n‘You are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker, I \\nbelieve?’ Pyotr Petrovitch put in, addressing Zossimov. He \\nwas standing, hat and gloves in hand, but before departing \\nhe felt disposed to throw off a few more intellectual phrases. \\nHe was evidently anxious to make a favourable impression \\nand his vanity overcame his prudence.\\n‘Yes. You’ve heard of it?’\\n‘Oh, yes, being in the neighbourhood.’\\n‘Do you know the details?’\\n‘I can’t say that; but another circumstance interests me \\nin the case— the whole question, so to say. Not to speak of \\nthe fact that crime has been greatly on the increase among \\nthe lower classes during the last five years, not to speak of \\nthe cases of robbery and arson everywhere, what strikes \\nme as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes, too, \\ncrime is increasing proportionately. In one place one hears \\nof a student’s robbing the mail on the high road; in another \\nplace people of good social position forge false banknotes; \\nin Moscow of late a whole gang has been captured who used \\nto forge lottery tickets, and one of the ringleaders was a lec-\\nturer in universal history; then our secretary abroad was \\nmurdered from some obscure motive of gain…. And if this \\nold woman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by some-\\none of a higher class in society—for peasants don’t pawn \\ngold trinkets— how are we to explain this demoralisation \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf6450\\nof the civilised part of our society?’\\n‘There are many economic changes,’ put in Zossimov.\\n‘How are we to explain it?’ Razumihin caught him up. ‘It \\nmight be explained by our inveterate impracticality.’\\n‘How do you mean?’\\n‘What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to \\nthe question why he was forging notes? ‘Everybody is get-\\nting rich one way or another, so I want to make haste to \\nget rich too.’ I don’t remember the exact words, but the up-\\nshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting \\nor working!

Strange \\nto say, he seemed immediately to have become perfectly \\ncalm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic \\nfear that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment \\nof a strange sudden calm. His movements were precise and \\ndefinite; a firm purpose was evident in them. ‘To-day, to-\\nday,’ he muttered to himself.

He took also all the copper change from \\nthe ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes. Then he \\nsoftly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and \\nglanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing \\nwith her back to him, blowing up the landlady’s samovar. \\nShe heard nothing. Who would have dreamed of his going \\nout, indeed? A minute later he was in the street.\\nIt was nearly eight o’clock, the sun was setting. It was as \\nstifling as before, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty \\ntown air. His head felt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy \\n\\uf645\\uf645\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ngleamed suddenly in his feverish eyes and his wasted, pale \\nand yellow face. He did not know and did not think where \\nhe was going, he had one thought only: ‘that all this must be \\nended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he would not \\nreturn home without it, because he would not go on living \\nlike that. ’ How, with what to make an end? He had not an \\nidea about it, he did not even want to think of it. He drove \\naway thought; thought tortured him. All he knew, all he felt \\nwas that everything must be changed ‘one way or another,’ \\nhe repeated with desperate and immovable self-confidence \\nand determination.\\nFrom old habit he took his usual walk in the direction \\nof the Hay Market. A dark-haired young man with a barrel \\norgan was standing in the road in front of a little general \\nshop and was grinding out a very sentimental song. He was \\naccompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood on the pavement \\nin front of him. She was dressed up in a crinoline, a man-\\ntle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all \\nvery old and shabby. In a strong and rather agreeable voice, \\ncracked and coarsened by street singing, she sang in hope \\nof getting a copper from the shop. Raskolnikov joined two \\nor three listeners, took out a five copeck piece and put it in \\nthe girl’s hand. She broke off abruptly on a sentimental high \\nnote, shouted sharply to the organ grinder ‘Come on,’ and \\nboth moved on to the next shop.\\n‘Do you like street music?’ said Raskolnikov, addressing \\na middle-aged man standing idly by him. The man looked \\nat him, startled and wondering.\\n‘I love to hear singing to a street organ,’ said Raskolnikov, \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf645\\uf649\\nand his manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the \\nsubject—‘I like it on cold, dark, damp autumn evenings—\\nthey must be damp—when all the passers-by have pale \\ngreen, sickly faces, or better still when wet snow is falling \\nstraight down, when there’s no wind—you know what I \\nmean?—and the street lamps shine through it …’\\n‘I don’t know…. Excuse me …’ muttered the stranger, \\nfrightened by the question and Raskolnikov’s strange man-\\nner, and he crossed over to the other side of the street.\\nRaskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the cor-\\nner of the Hay Market, where the huckster and his wife had \\ntalked with Lizaveta; but they were not there now. Recog-\\nnising the place, he stopped, looked round and addressed a \\nyoung fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a corn \\nchandler’s shop.\\n‘Isn’t there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this \\ncorner?’\\n‘All sorts of people keep booths here,’ answered the young \\nman, glancing superciliously at Raskolnikov.\\n‘What’s his name?’\\n‘What he was christened.’\\n‘Aren’t you a Zaraïsky man, too? Which province?’\\nThe young man looked at Raskolnikov again.\\n‘It’s not a province, your excellency, but a district.',\n",
              " 'Gra-\\nciously forgive me, your excellency!’\\n‘Is that a tavern at the top there?’\\n‘Yes, it’s an eating-house and there’s a billiard-room and \\nyou’ll find princesses there too…. La-la!’\\nRaskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner there was \\n\\uf645\\uf645\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\na dense crowd of peasants. He pushed his way into the thick-\\nest part of it, looking at the faces. He felt an unaccountable \\ninclination to enter into conversation with people. But the \\npeasants took no notice of him; they were all shouting in \\ngroups together. He stood and thought a little and took a \\nturning to the right in the direction of V.\\nHe had often crossed that little street which turns at an \\nangle, leading from the market-place to Sadovy Street. Of \\nlate he had often felt drawn to wander about this district, \\nwhen he felt depressed, that he might feel more so.\\nNow he walked along, thinking of nothing. At that point \\nthere is a great block of buildings, entirely let out in dram \\nshops and eating- houses; women were continually running \\nin and out, bare-headed and in their indoor clothes. Here \\nand there they gathered in groups, on the pavement, espe-\\ncially about the entrances to various festive establishments \\nin the lower storeys. From one of these a loud din, sounds \\nof singing, the tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, \\nfloated into the street. A crowd of women were throng-\\ning round the door; some were sitting on the steps, others \\non the pavement, others were standing talking. A drunk-\\nen soldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in \\nthe road, swearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way \\nsomewhere, but had forgotten where. One beggar was quar-\\nrelling with another, and a man dead drunk was lying right \\nacross the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng of women, \\nwho were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed \\nand wore cotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were \\nwomen of forty and some not more than seventeen; almost \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf645\\uf64b\\nall had blackened eyes.\\nHe felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise \\nand uproar in the saloon below…. someone could be heard \\nwithin dancing frantically, marking time with his heels to \\nthe sounds of the guitar and of a thin falsetto voice sing-\\ning a jaunty air. He listened intently, gloomily and dreamily, \\nbending down at the entrance and peeping inquisitively in \\nfrom the pavement.\\n‘Oh, my handsome soldier Don’t beat me for nothing,’\\ntrilled the thin voice of the singer. Raskolnikov felt a \\ngreat desire to make out what he was singing, as though ev-\\nerything depended on that.\\n‘Shall I go in?’ he thought. ‘They are laughing. From \\ndrink. Shall I get drunk?’\\n‘Won’t you come in?’ one of the women asked him. Her \\nvoice was still musical and less thick than the others, she \\nwas young and not repulsive—the only one of the group.\\n‘Why, she’s pretty,’ he said, drawing himself up and look-\\ning at her.\\nShe smiled, much pleased at the compliment.\\n‘You’re very nice looking yourself,’ she said.\\n‘Isn’t he thin though!’ observed another woman in a deep \\nbass. ‘Have you just come out of a hospital?’\\n‘They’re all generals’ daughters, it seems, but they have \\nall snub noses,’ interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile \\non his face, wearing a loose coat. ‘See how jolly they are.’\\n‘Go along with you!’\\n‘I’ll go, sweetie!’\\nAnd he darted down into the saloon below. Raskolnikov \\n\\uf645\\uf645\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nmoved on.\\n‘I say, sir,’ the girl shouted after him.',\n",
              " '‘What is it?’\\nShe hesitated.\\n‘I’ll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind \\ngentleman, but now I feel shy. Give me six copecks for a \\ndrink, there’s a nice young man!’\\nRaskolnikov gave her what came first—fifteen copecks.\\n‘Ah, what a good-natured gentleman!’\\n‘What’s your name?’\\n‘Ask for Duclida.’\\n‘Well, that’s too much,’ one of the women observed, shak-\\ning her head at Duclida. ‘I don’t know how you can ask like \\nthat. I believe I should drop with shame….’\\nRaskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker. She was a \\npock-marked wench of thirty, covered with bruises, with \\nher upper lip swollen. She made her criticism quietly and \\nearnestly. ‘Where is it,’ thought Raskolnikov. ‘Where is it \\nI’ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks, \\nan hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high \\nrock, on such a narrow ledge that he’d only room to stand, \\nand the ocean, everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, \\neverlasting tempest around him, if he had to remain stand-\\ning on a square yard of space all his life, a thousand years, \\neternity, it were better to live so than to die at once! Only to \\nlive, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be! … How true it \\nis! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature! … And vile \\nis he who calls him vile for that,’ he added a moment later.\\nHe went into another street. ‘Bah, the Palais de Cristal! \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf6460\\nRazumihin was just talking of the Palais de Cristal. But \\nwhat on earth was it I wanted? Yes, the newspapers…. Zos-\\nsimov said he’d read it in the papers. Have you the papers?’ \\nhe asked, going into a very spacious and positively clean \\nrestaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were, how-\\never, rather empty. Two or three people were drinking tea, \\nand in a room further away were sitting four men drinking \\nchampagne. Raskolnikov fancied that Zametov was one of \\nthem, but he could not be sure at that distance. ‘What if it \\nis?’ he thought.\\n‘Will you have vodka?’ asked the waiter.\\n‘Give me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones \\nfor the last five days, and I’ll give you something.’\\n‘Yes, sir, here’s to-day’s. No vodka?’\\nThe old newspapers and the tea were brought. Raskol-\\nnikov sat down and began to look through them.\\n‘Oh, damn … these are the items of intelligence. An \\naccident on a staircase, spontaneous combustion of a \\nshopkeeper from alcohol, a fire in Peski … a fire in the Pe-\\ntersburg quarter … another fire in the Petersburg quarter … \\nand another fire in the Petersburg quarter…. Ah, here it is!’ \\nHe found at last what he was seeking and began to read it. \\nThe lines danced before his eyes, but he read it all and began \\neagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers. \\nHis hands shook with nervous impatience as he turned the \\nsheets. Suddenly someone sat down beside him at his table. \\nHe looked up, it was the head clerk Zametov, looking just \\nthe same, with the rings on his fingers and the watch-chain, \\nwith the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the \\n\\uf645\\uf6461\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nsmart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen. He \\nwas in a good humour, at least he was smiling very gaily and \\ngood-humouredly. His dark face was rather flushed from \\nthe champagne he had drunk.\\n‘What, you here?’ he began in surprise, speaking as \\nthough he’d known him all his life. ‘Why, Razumihin told \\nme only yesterday you were unconscious. How strange! \\nAnd do you know I’ve been to see you?’\\nRaskolnikov knew he would come up to him. He laid \\naside the papers and turned to Zametov. There was a smile \\non his lips, and a new shade of irritable impatience was ap-\\nparent in that smile.',\n",
              " '‘I know you have,’ he answered. ‘I’ve heard it. You looked \\nfor my sock…. And you know Razumihin has lost his heart \\nto you? He says you’ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna’s—\\nyou know, the woman you tried to befriend, for whom \\nyou winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he would not \\nunderstand. Do you remember? How could he fail to un-\\nderstand—it was quite clear, wasn’t it?’\\n‘What a hot head he is!’\\n‘The explosive one?’\\n‘No, your friend Razumihin.’\\n‘You must have a jolly life, Mr. Zametov; entrance free to \\nthe most agreeable places. Who’s been pouring champagne \\ninto you just now?’\\n‘We’ve just been … having a drink together…. You talk \\nabout pouring it into me!’\\n‘By way of a fee! You profit by everything!’ Raskolnikov \\nlaughed, ‘it’s all right, my dear boy,’ he added, slapping Za-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf646\\uf645\\nmetov on the shoulder. ‘I am not speaking from temper, but \\nin a friendly way, for sport, as that workman of yours said \\nwhen he was scuffling with Dmitri, in the case of the old \\nwoman….’\\n‘How do you know about it?’\\n‘Perhaps I know more about it than you do.’\\n‘How strange you are…. I am sure you are still very un-\\nwell. You oughtn’t to have come out.’\\n‘Oh, do I seem strange to you?’\\n‘Yes. What are you doing, reading the papers?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘There’s a lot about the fires.’\\n‘No, I am not reading about the fires.’ Here he looked \\nmysteriously at Zametov; his lips were twisted again in a \\nmocking smile. ‘No, I am not reading about the fires,’ he \\nwent on, winking at Zametov. ‘But confess now, my dear \\nfellow, you’re awfully anxious to know what I am reading \\nabout?’\\n‘I am not in the least. Mayn’t I ask a question? Why do \\nyou keep on … ?’\\n‘Listen, you are a man of culture and education?’\\n‘I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium,’ said Zametov \\nwith some dignity.\\n‘Sixth class! Ah, my cock-sparrow! With your parting \\nand your rings— you are a gentleman of fortune. Foo! what \\na charming boy!’ Here Raskolnikov broke into a nervous \\nlaugh right in Zametov’s face. The latter drew back, more \\namazed than offended.\\n‘Foo! how strange you are!’ Zametov repeated very seri-\\n\\uf645\\uf646\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nously. ‘I can’t help thinking you are still delirious.’\\n‘I am delirious? You are fibbing, my cock-sparrow! So I \\nam strange? You find me curious, do you?’\\n‘Yes, curious.’\\n‘Shall I tell you what I was reading about, what I was \\nlooking for? See what a lot of papers I’ve made them bring \\nme. Suspicious, eh?’\\n‘Well, what is it?’\\n‘You prick up your ears?’\\n‘How do you mean—‘prick up my ears’?’\\n‘I’ll explain that afterwards, but now, my boy, I declare to \\nyou … no, better ‘I confess’ … No, that’s not right either; ‘I \\nmake a deposition and you take it.’ I depose that I was read-\\ning, that I was looking and searching….’ he screwed up his \\neyes and paused. ‘I was searching—and came here on pur-\\npose to do it—for news of the murder of the old pawnbroker \\nwoman,’ he articulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringing \\nhis face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov. Zametov \\nlooked at him steadily, without moving or drawing his face \\naway. What struck Zametov afterwards as the strangest part \\nof it all was that silence followed for exactly a minute, and \\nthat they gazed at one another all the while.\\n‘What if you have been reading about it?’ he cried at last, \\nperplexed and impatient. ‘That’s no business of mine! What \\nof it?’\\n‘The same old woman,’ Raskolnikov went on in the same \\nwhisper, not heeding Zametov’s explanation, ‘about whom \\nyou were talking in the police-office, you remember, when I \\nfainted. Well, do you understand now?’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf646\\uf647\\n‘What do you mean? Understand … what?’ Zametov \\nbrought out, almost alarmed.\\nRaskolnikov’s set and earnest face was suddenly trans-\\nformed, and he suddenly went off into the same nervous \\nlaugh as before, as though utterly unable to restrain himself.',\n",
              " 'And in one flash he recalled with extraordinary vividness of \\nsensation a moment in the recent past, that moment when \\nhe stood with the axe behind the door, while the latch trem-\\nbled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he had a \\nsudden desire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out \\nhis tongue at them, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and \\nlaugh!\\n‘You are either mad, or …’ began Zametov, and he broke \\noff, as though stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed \\ninto his mind.\\n‘Or? Or what? What? Come, tell me!’\\n‘Nothing,’ said Zametov, getting angry, ‘it’s all non-\\nsense!’\\nBoth were silent. After his sudden fit of laughter Raskol-\\nnikov became suddenly thoughtful and melancholy. He put \\nhis elbow on the table and leaned his head on his hand. He \\nseemed to have completely forgotten Zametov. The silence \\nlasted for some time.\\n‘Why don’t you drink your tea? It’s getting cold,’ said Za-\\nmetov.\\n‘What! Tea? Oh, yes….’ Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put \\na morsel of bread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Za-\\nmetov, seemed to remember everything and pulled himself \\ntogether. At the same moment his face resumed its original \\n\\uf645\\uf646\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nmocking expression. He went on drinking tea.\\n‘There have been a great many of these crimes lately,’ said \\nZametov. ‘Only the other day I read in the Moscow News \\nthat a whole gang of false coiners had been caught in Mos-\\ncow. It was a regular society. They used to forge tickets!’\\n‘Oh, but it was a long time ago! I read about it a month \\nago,’ Raskolnikov answered calmly. ‘So you consider them \\ncriminals?’ he added, smiling.\\n‘Of course they are criminals.’\\n‘They? They are children, simpletons, not criminals! Why, \\nhalf a hundred people meeting for such an object—what an \\nidea! Three would be too many, and then they want to have \\nmore faith in one another than in themselves! One has only \\nto blab in his cups and it all collapses. Simpletons! They en-\\ngaged untrustworthy people to change the notes— what a \\nthing to trust to a casual stranger! Well, let us suppose that \\nthese simpletons succeed and each makes a million, and \\nwhat follows for the rest of their lives? Each is dependent \\non the others for the rest of his life! Better hang oneself at \\nonce! And they did not know how to change the notes ei-\\nther; the man who changed the notes took five thousand \\nroubles, and his hands trembled. He counted the first four \\nthousand, but did not count the fifth thousand—he was in \\nsuch a hurry to get the money into his pocket and run away. \\nOf course he roused suspicion. And the whole thing came \\nto a crash through one fool! Is it possible?’\\n‘That his hands trembled?’ observed Zametov, ‘yes, that’s \\nquite possible. That, I feel quite sure, is possible. Sometimes \\none can’t stand things.’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf646\\uf649\\n‘Can’t stand that?’\\n‘Why, could you stand it then? No, I couldn’t. For the \\nsake of a hundred roubles to face such a terrible experience? \\nTo go with false notes into a bank where it’s their business \\nto spot that sort of thing! No, I should not have the face to \\ndo it. Would you?’\\nRaskolnikov had an intense desire again ‘to put his \\ntongue out.’ Shivers kept running down his spine.\\n‘I should do it quite differently,’ Raskolnikov began. ‘This \\nis how I would change the notes: I’d count the first thousand \\nthree or four times backwards and forwards, looking at ev-\\nery note and then I’d set to the second thousand; I’d count \\nthat half-way through and then hold some fifty-rouble note \\nto the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light again—to \\nsee whether it was a good one. ‘I am afraid,’ I would say, \\n‘a relation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day \\nthrough a false note,’ and then I’d tell them the whole sto-\\nry. And after I began counting the third, ‘No, excuse me,’ I \\nwould say, ‘I fancy I made a mistake in the seventh hundred \\nin that second thousand, I am not sure.’ And so I would give \\nup the third thousand and go back to the second and so on \\nto the end. And when I had finished, I’d pick out one from \\nthe fifth and one from the second thousand and take them \\nagain to the light and ask again, ‘Change them, please,’ and \\nput the clerk into such a stew that he would not know how \\nto get rid of me. When I’d finished and had gone out, I’d \\ncome back, ‘No, excuse me,’ and ask for some explanation. \\nThat’s how I’d do it.’\\n‘Foo! what terrible things you say!’ said Zametov, laugh-\\n\\uf645\\uf646\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ning. ‘But all that is only talk.',\n",

Somewhat too much earnestness began to appear in his \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf646\\uf64b\\nwords and looks.\\n‘Very much?’\\n‘Very much!’\\n‘All right then. This is how I should behave,’ Raskolnikov \\nbegan, again bringing his face close to Zametov’s, again \\nstaring at him and speaking in a whisper, so that the lat-\\nter positively shuddered. ‘This is what I should have done. \\nI should have taken the money and jewels, I should have \\nwalked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted \\nplace with fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, \\nsome kitchen garden or place of that sort.

And, well, they could search! There’d \\nbe no trace.’\\n‘You are a madman,’ said Zametov, and for some reason \\nhe too spoke in a whisper, and moved away from Raskol-\\nnikov, whose eyes were glittering.

His face wore a contorted smile.\\n‘But is it possible?’ he brought out faintly.

You \\nknow I’m having a house-warming this evening, I dare say \\nthey’ve arrived by now, but I left my uncle there—I just ran \\nin—to receive the guests. And if you weren’t a fool, a com-\\nmon fool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of \\na translation … you see, Rodya, I recognise you’re a clever \\nfellow, but you’re a fool!—and if you weren’t a fool you’d \\ncome round to me this evening instead of wearing out your \\nboots in the street! Since you have gone out, there’s no help \\nfor it! I’d give you a snug easy chair, my landlady has one … \\na cup of tea, company…. Or you could lie on the sofa—any \\nway you would be with us…. Zossimov will be there too. \\nWill you come?’\\n‘No.',\n",
              " '’\\n‘R-rubbish!’ Razumihin shouted, out of patience. ‘How \\ndo you know? You can’t answer for yourself! You don’t know \\nanything about it…. Thousands of times I’ve fought tooth \\nand nail with people and run back to them afterwards…. \\nOne feels ashamed and goes back to a man!

Whom? Me? I’d twist his nose off at the mere idea! \\nPotchinkov’s house, 47, Babushkin’s flat….’\\n‘I shall not come, Razumihin.’ Raskolnikov turned and \\nwalked away.\\n‘I bet you will,’ Razumihin shouted after him. ‘I refuse to \\nknow you if you don’t! Stay, hey, is Zametov in there?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘Did you see him?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘Talked to him?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘What about? Confound you, don’t tell me then. \\nPotchinkov’s house, 47, Babushkin’s flat, remember!’\\nRaskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into Sa-\\ndovy Street. Razumihin looked after him thoughtfully. \\nThen with a wave of his hand he went into the house but \\nstopped short of the stairs.\\n‘Confound it,’ he went on almost aloud. ‘He talked sensi-\\nbly but yet … I am a fool! As if madmen didn’t talk sensibly! \\nAnd this was just what Zossimov seemed afraid of.’ He \\nstruck his finger on his forehead. ‘What if … how could I \\nlet him go off alone? He may drown himself…. Ach, what a \\nblunder! I can’t.’ And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, \\nbut there was no trace of him. With a curse he returned \\nwith rapid steps to the Palais de Cristal to question Zame-\\ntov.\\nRaskolnikov walked straight to X—— Bridge, stood in \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf647\\uf647\\nthe middle, and leaning both elbows on the rail stared into \\nthe distance. On parting with Razumihin, he felt so much \\nweaker that he could scarcely reach this place. He longed to \\nsit or lie down somewhere in the street. Bending over the \\nwater, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the \\nsunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering \\ntwilight, at one distant attic window on the left bank, flash-\\ning as though on fire in the last rays of the setting sun, at \\nthe darkening water of the canal, and the water seemed to \\ncatch his attention. At last red circles flashed before his eyes, \\nthe houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal banks, \\nthe carriages, all danced before his eyes. Suddenly he start-\\ned, saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and \\nhideous sight. He became aware of someone standing on \\nthe right side of him; he looked and saw a tall woman with \\na kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow, wasted face and \\nred sunken eyes. She was looking straight at him, but obvi-\\nously she saw nothing and recognised no one. Suddenly she \\nleaned her right hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg \\nover the railing, then her left and threw herself into the ca-\\nnal. The filthy water parted and swallowed up its victim for \\na moment, but an instant later the drowning woman float-\\ned to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head \\nand legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over \\nher back.\\n‘A woman drowning! A woman drowning!’ shouted doz-\\nens of voices; people ran up, both banks were thronged \\nwith spectators, on the bridge people crowded about Ras-\\nkolnikov, pressing up behind him.\\n\\uf645\\uf647\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘Mercy on it! it’s our Afrosinya!’ a woman cried tearfully \\nclose by. ‘Mercy! save her! kind people, pull her out!’\\n‘A boat, a boat’ was shouted in the crowd. But there was \\nno need of a boat; a policeman ran down the steps to the ca-\\nnal, threw off his great coat and his boots and rushed into \\nthe water.',\n",
              " 'It was easy to reach her: she floated within a cou-\\nple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of her clothes \\nwith his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a \\ncomrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled \\nout at once. They laid her on the granite pavement of the \\nembankment. She soon recovered consciousness, raised \\nher head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing, stupidly \\nwiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.\\n‘She’s drunk herself out of her senses,’ the same woman’s \\nvoice wailed at her side. ‘Out of her senses. The other day \\nshe tried to hang herself, we cut her down. I ran out to the \\nshop just now, left my little girl to look after her—and here \\nshe’s in trouble again! A neighbour, gentleman, a neighbour, \\nwe live close by, the second house from the end, see yon-\\nder….’\\nThe crowd broke up. The police still remained round the \\nwoman, someone mentioned the police station…. Raskol-\\nnikov looked on with a strange sensation of indifference and \\napathy. He felt disgusted. ‘No, that’s loathsome … water … \\nit’s not good enough,’ he muttered to himself. ‘Nothing will \\ncome of it,’ he added, ‘no use to wait. What about the police \\noffice … ? And why isn’t Zametov at the police office? The \\npolice office is open till ten o’clock….’ He turned his back to \\nthe railing and looked about him.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf647\\uf649\\n‘Very well then!’ he said resolutely; he moved from the \\nbridge and walked in the direction of the police office. His \\nheart felt hollow and empty. He did not want to think. Even \\nhis depression had passed, there was not a trace now of the \\nenergy with which he had set out ‘to make an end of it all.’ \\nComplete apathy had succeeded to it.\\n‘Well, it’s a way out of it,’ he thought, walking slowly and \\nlistlessly along the canal bank. ‘Anyway I’ll make an end, \\nfor I want to…. But is it a way out? What does it matter! \\nThere’ll be the square yard of space—ha! But what an end! \\nIs it really the end? Shall I tell them or not? Ah … damn! \\nHow tired I am! If I could find somewhere to sit or lie down \\nsoon! What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid. But \\nI don’t care about that either! What idiotic ideas come into \\none’s head.’\\nTo reach the police office he had to go straight forward \\nand take the second turning to the left. It was only a few \\npaces away. But at the first turning he stopped and, after \\na minute’s thought, turned into a side street and went two \\nstreets out of his way, possibly without any object, or pos-\\nsibly to delay a minute and gain time. He walked, looking \\nat the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in \\nhis ear; he lifted his head and saw that he was standing at \\nthe very gate of the house. He had not passed it, he had not \\nbeen near it since that evening. An overwhelming, unac-\\ncountable prompting drew him on. He went into the house, \\npassed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on \\nthe right, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the \\nfourth storey. The narrow, steep staircase was very dark. He \\n\\uf645\\uf647\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nstopped at each landing and looked round him with curios-\\nity; on the first landing the framework of the window had \\nbeen taken out. ‘That wasn’t so then,’ he thought. Here was \\nthe flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had \\nbeen working. ‘It’s shut up and the door newly painted. So \\nit’s to let.’ Then the third storey and the fourth.',\n",
              " '‘Here!’ He \\nwas perplexed to find the door of the flat wide open. There \\nwere men there, he could hear voices; he had not expected \\nthat. After brief hesitation he mounted the last stairs and \\nwent into the flat. It, too, was being done up; there were \\nworkmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow \\nfancied that he would find everything as he left it, even per-\\nhaps the corpses in the same places on the floor. And now, \\nbare walls, no furniture; it seemed strange. He walked to \\nthe window and sat down on the window-sill. There were \\ntwo workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger \\nthan the other. They were papering the walls with a new \\nwhite paper covered with lilac flowers, instead of the old, \\ndirty, yellow one. Raskolnikov for some reason felt horribly \\nannoyed by this. He looked at the new paper with dislike, as \\nthough he felt sorry to have it all so changed. The workmen \\nhad obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were \\nhurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go \\nhome. They took no notice of Raskolnikov’s coming in; they \\nwere talking. Raskolnikov folded his arms and listened.\\n‘She comes to me in the morning,’ said the elder to the \\nyounger, ‘very early, all dressed up. ‘Why are you preen-\\ning and prinking?’ says I. ‘I am ready to do anything to \\nplease you, Tit Vassilitch!’ That’s a way of going on! And she \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf647\\uf64b\\ndressed up like a regular fashion book!’\\n‘And what is a fashion book?’ the younger one asked. He \\nobviously regarded the other as an authority.\\n‘A fashion book is a lot of pictures, coloured, and they \\ncome to the tailors here every Saturday, by post from \\nabroad, to show folks how to dress, the male sex as well as \\nthe female. They’re pictures. The gentlemen are generally \\nwearing fur coats and for the ladies’ fluffles, they’re beyond \\nanything you can fancy.’\\n‘There’s nothing you can’t find in Petersburg,’ the young-\\ner cried enthusiastically, ‘except father and mother, there’s \\neverything!’\\n‘Except them, there’s everything to be found, my boy,’ \\nthe elder declared sententiously.\\nRaskolnikov got up and walked into the other room \\nwhere the strong box, the bed, and the chest of drawers \\nhad been; the room seemed to him very tiny without furni-\\nture in it. The paper was the same; the paper in the corner \\nshowed where the case of ikons had stood. He looked at it \\nand went to the window. The elder workman looked at him \\naskance.\\n‘What do you want?’ he asked suddenly.\\nInstead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage \\nand pulled the bell. The same bell, the same cracked note. \\nHe rang it a second and a third time; he listened and re-\\nmembered. The hideous and agonisingly fearful sensation \\nhe had felt then began to come back more and more vividly. \\nHe shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more \\nsatisfaction.\\n\\uf645\\uf647\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘Well, what do you want? Who are you?’ the workman \\nshouted, going out to him. Raskolnikov went inside again.\\n‘I want to take a flat,’ he said. ‘I am looking round.’\\n‘It’s not the time to look at rooms at night! and you ought \\nto come up with the porter.’\\n‘The floors have been washed, will they be painted?’ Ras-\\nkolnikov went on. ‘Is there no blood?’\\n‘What blood?’\\n‘Why, the old woman and her sister were murdered here.',\n",
              " 'There was a perfect pool there.’\\n‘But who are you?’ the workman cried, uneasy.\\n‘Who am I?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘You want to know? Come to the police station, I’ll tell \\nyou.’\\nThe workmen looked at him in amazement.\\n‘It’s time for us to go, we are late. Come along, Alyoshka. \\nWe must lock up,’ said the elder workman.\\n‘Very well, come along,’ said Raskolnikov indifferently, \\nand going out first, he went slowly downstairs. ‘Hey, porter,’ \\nhe cried in the gateway.\\nAt the entrance several people were standing, staring at \\nthe passers- by; the two porters, a peasant woman, a man \\nin a long coat and a few others. Raskolnikov went straight \\nup to them.\\n‘What do you want?’ asked one of the porters.\\n‘Have you been to the police office?’\\n‘I’ve just been there. What do you want?’\\n‘Is it open?’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf6480\\n‘Of course.’\\n‘Is the assistant there?’\\n‘He was there for a time. What do you want?’\\nRaskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost \\nin thought.\\n‘He’s been to look at the flat,’ said the elder workman, \\ncoming forward.\\n‘Which flat?’\\n‘Where we are at work. ‘Why have you washed away the \\nblood?’ says he. ‘There has been a murder here,’ says he, ‘and \\nI’ve come to take it.’ And he began ringing at the bell, all but \\nbroke it. ‘Come to the police station,’ says he. ‘I’ll tell you \\neverything there.’ He wouldn’t leave us.’\\nThe porter looked at Raskolnikov, frowning and per-\\nplexed.\\n‘Who are you?’ he shouted as impressively as he could.\\n‘I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a stu-\\ndent, I live in Shil’s house, not far from here, flat Number 14, \\nask the porter, he knows me.’ Raskolnikov said all this in a \\nlazy, dreamy voice, not turning round, but looking intently \\ninto the darkening street.\\n‘Why have you been to the flat?’\\n‘To look at it.’\\n‘What is there to look at?’\\n‘Take him straight to the police station,’ the man in the \\nlong coat jerked in abruptly.\\nRaskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder \\nand said in the same slow, lazy tones:\\n‘Come along.’\\n\\uf645\\uf6481\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘Yes, take him,’ the man went on more confidently. ‘Why \\nwas he going into that what’s in his mind, eh?’\\n‘He’s not drunk, but God knows what’s the matter with \\nhim,’ muttered the workman.\\n‘But what do you want?’ the porter shouted again, be-\\nginning to get angry in earnest—‘Why are you hanging \\nabout?’\\n‘You funk the police station then?’ said Raskolnikov jeer-\\ningly.\\n‘How funk it? Why are you hanging about?’\\n‘He’s a rogue!’ shouted the peasant woman.\\n‘Why waste time talking to him?’ cried the other porter, \\na huge peasant in a full open coat and with keys on his belt. \\n‘Get along! He is a rogue and no mistake. Get along!’\\nAnd seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him \\ninto the street.',\n",

But no sound came, all was dead and silent like \\nthe stones on which he walked, dead to him, to him alone…. \\nAll at once at the end of the street, two hundred yards away, \\nin the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and \\nshouts. In the middle of the crowd stood a carriage…. A \\nlight gleamed in the middle of the street. ‘What is it?’ Ras-\\nkolnikov turned to the right and went up to the crowd. He \\nseemed to clutch at everything and smiled coldly when he \\nrecognised it, for he had fully made up his mind to go to the \\npolice station and knew that it would all soon be over.\\n\\uf645\\uf648\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter VII\\nA\\nn elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with \\na pair of spirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and \\nthe coachman had got off his box and stood by; the hors-\\nes were being held by the bridle…. A mass of people had \\ngathered round, the police standing in front. One of them \\nheld a lighted lantern which he was turning on something \\nlying close to the wheels. Everyone was talking, shouting, \\nexclaiming; the coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeat-\\ning:\\n‘What a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!’\\nRaskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and \\nsucceeded at last in seeing the object of the commotion and \\ninterest. On the ground a man who had been run over lay \\napparently unconscious, and covered with blood; he was \\nvery badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood was flow-\\ning from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated \\nand disfigured. He was evidently badly injured.\\n‘Merciful heaven!’ wailed the coachman, ‘what more \\ncould I do? If I’d been driving fast or had not shouted to \\nhim, but I was going quietly, not in a hurry. Everyone could \\nsee I was going along just like everybody else. A drunken \\nman can’t walk straight, we all know…. I saw him cross-\\ning the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again \\nand a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf648\\uf647\\nhe fell straight under their feet!

It was evident that the carriage belonged to a \\nrich and important person who was awaiting it somewhere; \\nthe police, of course, were in no little anxiety to avoid up-\\nsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was to take the \\ninjured man to the police station and the hospital. No one \\nknew his name.\\nMeanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped \\ncloser over him. The lantern suddenly lighted up the unfor-\\ntunate man’s face. He recognised him.\\n‘I know him!

              " 'Make \\nhaste for a doctor! I will pay, see?’ He pulled money out of \\nhis pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in vio-\\nlent agitation.\\nThe police were glad that they had found out who the \\nman was. Raskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, \\nas earnestly as if it had been his father, he besought the po-\\nlice to carry the unconscious Marmeladov to his lodging at \\nonce.\\n\\uf645\\uf648\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘Just here, three houses away,’ he said eagerly, ‘the house \\nbelongs to Kozel, a rich German.

Of late she \\nhad begun to talk more than ever to her eldest girl, Polen-\\nka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not \\nunderstand, understood very well that her mother needed \\nher, and so always watched her with her big clever eyes and \\nstrove her utmost to appear to understand. This time Polen-\\nka was undressing her little brother, who had been unwell \\nall day and was going to bed. The boy was waiting for her \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf648\\uf649\\nto take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night. He \\nwas sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent, \\nserious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him \\n—heels together and toes turned out.\\nHe was listening to what his mother was saying to his \\nsister, sitting perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open \\neyes, just as all good little boys have to sit when they are \\nundressed to go to bed. A little girl, still younger, dressed \\nliterally in rags, stood at the screen, waiting for her turn. \\nThe door on to the stairs was open to relieve them a little \\nfrom the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the \\nother rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in \\nthe poor, consumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed \\nto have grown even thinner during that week and the hectic \\nflush on her face was brighter than ever.\\n‘You wouldn’t believe, you can’t imagine, Polenka,’ she \\nsaid, walking about the room, ‘what a happy luxurious \\nlife we had in my papa’s house and how this drunkard has \\nbrought me, and will bring you all, to ruin! Papa was a civ-\\nil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that \\neveryone who came to see him said, ‘We look upon you, \\nIvan Mihailovitch, as our governor!’ When I … when …’ \\nshe coughed violently, ‘oh, cursed life,’ she cried, clearing \\nher throat and pressing her hands to her breast, ‘when I … \\nwhen at the last ball … at the marshal’s … Princess Bezze-\\nmelny saw me—who gave me the blessing when your father \\nand I were married, Polenka—she asked at once ‘Isn’t that \\nthe pretty girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-\\nup?’ (You must mend that tear, you must take your needle \\n\\uf645\\uf648\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nand darn it as I showed you, or to-morrow—cough, cough, \\ncough—he will make the hole bigger,’ she articulated with \\neffort.) ‘Prince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just \\ncome from Petersburg then … he danced the mazurka with \\nme and wanted to make me an offer next day; but I thanked \\nhim in flattering expressions and told him that my heart \\nhad long been another’s.

I am the landlady!’\\n‘Amalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what you are \\nsaying,’ Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always \\ntook a haughty tone with the landlady that she might ‘re-\\nmember her place’ and even now could not deny herself this \\nsatisfaction). ‘Amalia Ludwigovna …’\\n\\uf645\\uf6491\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘I have you once before told that you to call me Amalia \\nLudwigovna may not dare; I am Amalia Ivanovna.’\\n‘You are not Amalia Ivanovna, but Amalia Ludwigovna, \\nand as I am not one of your despicable flatterers like Mr. Le-\\nbeziatnikov, who’s laughing behind the door at this moment \\n(a laugh and a cry of ‘they are at it again’ was in fact audible \\nat the door) so I shall always call you Amalia Ludwigovna, \\nthough I fail to understand why you dislike that name.',\n",
              " 'You \\ncan see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaha-\\nrovitch; he is dying. I beg you to close that door at once and \\nto admit no one. Let him at least die in peace! Or I warn \\nyou the Governor-General, himself, shall be informed of \\nyour conduct to-morrow. The prince knew me as a girl; he \\nremembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often been a \\nbenefactor to him. Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharov-\\nitch had many friends and protectors, whom he abandoned \\nhimself from an honourable pride, knowing his unhappy \\nweakness, but now (she pointed to Raskolnikov) a generous \\nyoung man has come to our assistance, who has wealth and \\nconnections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known \\nfrom a child. You may rest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna …’\\nAll this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quick-\\ner and quicker, but a cough suddenly cut short Katerina \\nIvanovna’s eloquence. At that instant the dying man re-\\ncovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she ran to him. \\nThe injured man opened his eyes and without recognition \\nor understanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending \\nover him. He drew deep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed \\nat the corners of his mouth and drops of perspiration came \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf649\\uf645\\nout on his forehead. Not recognising Raskolnikov, he began \\nlooking round uneasily. Katerina Ivanovna looked at him \\nwith a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her eyes.\\n‘My God! His whole chest is crushed! How he is bleeding,’ \\nshe said in despair. ‘We must take off his clothes. Turn a lit-\\ntle, Semyon Zaharovitch, if you can,’ she cried to him.\\nMarmeladov recognised her.\\n‘A priest,’ he articulated huskily.\\nKaterina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head \\nagainst the window frame and exclaimed in despair:\\n‘Oh, cursed life!’\\n‘A priest,’ the dying man said again after a moment’s si-\\nlence.\\n‘They’ve gone for him,’ Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, \\nhe obeyed her shout and was silent. With sad and timid eyes \\nhe looked for her; she returned and stood by his pillow. He \\nseemed a little easier but not for long.\\nSoon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was \\nshaking in the corner, as though she were in a fit, and star-\\ning at him with her wondering childish eyes.\\n‘A-ah,’ he signed towards her uneasily. He wanted to say \\nsomething.\\n‘What now?’ cried Katerina Ivanovna.\\n‘Barefoot, barefoot!’ he muttered, indicating with fren-\\nzied eyes the child’s bare feet.\\n‘Be silent,’ Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, ‘you know \\nwhy she is barefooted.’\\n‘Thank God, the doctor,’ exclaimed Raskolnikov, re-\\nlieved.\\n\\uf645\\uf649\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nThe doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, \\nlooking about him mistrustfully; he went up to the sick \\nman, took his pulse, carefully felt his head and with the \\nhelp of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the blood-stained \\nshirt, and bared the injured man’s chest. It was gashed, \\ncrushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were \\nbroken. On the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sin-\\nister-looking yellowish-black bruise—a cruel kick from the \\nhorse’s hoof. The doctor frowned. The policeman told him \\nthat he was caught in the wheel and turned round with it for \\nthirty yards on the road.\\n‘It’s wonderful that he has recovered consciousness,’ the \\ndoctor whispered softly to Raskolnikov.\\n‘What do you think of him?’ he asked.\\n‘He will die immediately.’\\n‘Is there really no hope?’\\n‘Not the faintest! He is at the last gasp…. His head is bad-\\nly injured, too … Hm … I could bleed him if you like, but … \\nit would be useless. He is bound to die within the next five \\nor ten minutes.’\\n‘Better bleed him then.',\n",
              " '’\\n‘If you like…. But I warn you it will be perfectly useless.’\\nAt that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the \\npassage parted, and the priest, a little, grey old man, ap-\\npeared in the doorway bearing the sacrament. A policeman \\nhad gone for him at the time of the accident. The doctor \\nchanged places with him, exchanging glances with him. \\nRaskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He \\nshrugged his shoulders and remained.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf649\\uf647\\nAll stepped back. The confession was soon over. The \\ndying man probably understood little; he could only ut-\\nter indistinct broken sounds. Katerina Ivanovna took little \\nLida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt down in the cor-\\nner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of her. \\nThe little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on \\nhis little bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing \\nhimself with precision and bowed down, touching the floor \\nwith his forehead, which seemed to afford him especial sat-\\nisfaction. Katerina Ivanovna bit her lips and held back her \\ntears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling straight the \\nboy’s shirt, and managed to cover the girl’s bare shoulders \\nwith a kerchief, which she took from the chest without ris-\\ning from her knees or ceasing to pray. Meanwhile the door \\nfrom the inner rooms was opened inquisitively again. In \\nthe passage the crowd of spectators from all the flats on the \\nstaircase grew denser and denser, but they did not venture \\nbeyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the \\nscene.\\nAt that moment Polenka forced her way through the \\ncrowd at the door. She came in panting from running so \\nfast, took off her kerchief, looked for her mother, went up \\nto her and said, ‘She’s coming, I met her in the street.’ Her \\nmother made her kneel beside her.\\nTimidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way \\nthrough the crowd, and strange was her appearance in \\nthat room, in the midst of want, rags, death and despair. \\nShe, too, was in rags, her attire was all of the cheapest, but \\ndecked out in gutter finery of a special stamp, unmistakably \\n\\uf645\\uf649\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nbetraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in the \\ndoorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of \\neverything. She forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so \\nunseemly here with its ridiculous long train, and her im-\\nmense crinoline that filled up the whole doorway, and her \\nlight-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought with her, \\nthough it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw \\nhat with its flaring flame-coloured feather. Under this rak-\\nishly-tilted hat was a pale, frightened little face with lips \\nparted and eyes staring in terror. Sonia was a small thin \\ngirl of eighteen with fair hair, rather pretty, with wonderful \\nblue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and the priest; she \\ntoo was out of breath with running. At last whispers, some \\nwords in the crowd probably, reached her. She looked down \\nand took a step forward into the room, still keeping close \\nto the door.\\nThe service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went up to her \\nhusband again. The priest stepped back and turned to say a \\nfew words of admonition and consolation to Katerina Iva-\\nnovna on leaving.\\n‘What am I to do with these?’ she interrupted sharply \\nand irritably, pointing to the little ones.\\n‘God is merciful; look to the Most High for succour,’ the \\npriest began.\\n‘Ach! He is merciful, but not to us.’\\n‘That’s a sin, a sin, madam,’ observed the priest, shaking \\nhis head.\\n‘And isn’t that a sin?’ cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing \\nto the dying man.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf649\\uf649\\n‘Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the acci-\\ndent will agree to compensate you, at least for the loss of \\nhis earnings.’\\n‘You don’t understand!’ cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily \\nwaving her hand. ‘And why should they compensate me? \\nWhy, he was drunk and threw himself under the horses! \\nWhat earnings? He brought us in nothing but misery.',\n",
              " 'He \\ndrank everything away, the drunkard! He robbed us to get \\ndrink, he wasted their lives and mine for drink! And thank \\nGod he’s dying! One less to keep!’\\n‘You must forgive in the hour of death, that’s a sin, mad-\\nam, such feelings are a great sin.’\\nKaterina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she \\nwas giving him water, wiping the blood and sweat from his \\nhead, setting his pillow straight, and had only turned now \\nand then for a moment to address the priest. Now she flew \\nat him almost in a frenzy.\\n‘Ah, father! That’s words and only words! Forgive! If he’d \\nnot been run over, he’d have come home to-day drunk and \\nhis only shirt dirty and in rags and he’d have fallen asleep \\nlike a log, and I should have been sousing and rinsing till \\ndaybreak, washing his rags and the children’s and then \\ndrying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight \\nI should have been darning them. That’s how I spend my \\nnights! … What’s the use of talking of forgiveness! I have \\nforgiven as it is!’\\nA terrible hollow cough interrupted her words. She put \\nher handkerchief to her lips and showed it to the priest, \\npressing her other hand to her aching chest. The handker-\\n\\uf645\\uf649\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nchief was covered with blood. The priest bowed his head \\nand said nothing.\\nMarmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his \\neyes off the face of Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending \\nover him again. He kept trying to say something to her; he \\nbegan moving his tongue with difficulty and articulating \\nindistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he \\nwanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:\\n‘Be silent! No need! I know what you want to say!’ And \\nthe sick man was silent, but at the same instant his wander-\\ning eyes strayed to the doorway and he saw Sonia.\\nTill then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the \\nshadow in a corner.\\n‘Who’s that? Who’s that?’ he said suddenly in a thick \\ngasping voice, in agitation, turning his eyes in horror to-\\nwards the door where his daughter was standing, and trying \\nto sit up.\\n‘Lie down! Lie do-own!’ cried Katerina Ivanovna.\\nWith unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping \\nhimself on his elbow. He looked wildly and fixedly for some \\ntime on his daughter, as though not recognising her. He had \\nnever seen her before in such attire. Suddenly he recognised \\nher, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and gaudy \\nfinery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dy-\\ning father. His face showed intense suffering.\\n‘Sonia! Daughter! Forgive!’ he cried, and he tried to hold \\nout his hand to her, but losing his balance, he fell off the \\nsofa, face downwards on the floor. They rushed to pick him \\nup, they put him on the sofa; but he was dying. Sonia with \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf649\\uf64b\\na faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so without \\nmoving. He died in her arms.\\n‘He’s got what he wanted,’ Katerina Ivanovna cried, see-\\ning her husband’s dead body. ‘Well, what’s to be done now? \\nHow am I to bury him! What can I give them to-morrow \\nto eat?’\\nRaskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.\\n‘Katerina Ivanovna,’ he began, ‘last week your husband \\ntold me all his life and circumstances…. Believe me, he \\nspoke of you with passionate reverence. From that evening, \\nwhen I learnt how devoted he was to you all and how he \\nloved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna, in \\nspite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we be-\\ncame friends…. Allow me now … to do something … to \\nrepay my debt to my dead friend. Here are twenty roubles, I \\nthink—and if that can be of any assistance to you, then … I \\n… in short, I will come again, I will be sure to come again … \\nI shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow…. Good-bye!’\\nAnd he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way \\nthrough the crowd to the stairs. But in the crowd he sud-\\ndenly jostled against Nikodim Fomitch, who had heard of \\nthe accident and had come to give instructions in person. \\nThey had not met since the scene at the police station, but \\nNikodim Fomitch knew him instantly.\\n‘Ah, is that you?’ he asked him.\\n‘He’s dead,’ answered Raskolnikov. ‘The doctor and the \\npriest have been, all as it should have been. Don’t worry the \\npoor woman too much, she is in consumption as it is. Try \\nand cheer her up, if possible … you are a kind-hearted man, \\n\\uf645\\uf649\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nI know …’ he added with a smile, looking straight in his \\nface.\\n‘But you are spattered with blood,’ observed Nikodim \\nFomitch, noticing in the lamplight some fresh stains on \\nRaskolnikov’s waistcoat.',\n",
              " '‘Yes … I’m covered with blood,’ Raskolnikov said with a \\npeculiar air; then he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.\\nHe walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but \\nnot conscious of it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelm-\\ning sensation of life and strength that surged up suddenly \\nwithin him. This sensation might be compared to that of a \\nman condemned to death who has suddenly been pardoned. \\nHalfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest \\non his way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a \\nsilent greeting with him. He was just descending the last \\nsteps when he heard rapid footsteps behind him. someone \\novertook him; it was Polenka. She was running after him, \\ncalling ‘Wait! wait!’\\nHe turned round. She was at the bottom of the staircase \\nand stopped short a step above him. A dim light came in \\nfrom the yard. Raskolnikov could distinguish the child’s \\nthin but pretty little face, looking at him with a bright child-\\nish smile. She had run after him with a message which she \\nwas evidently glad to give.\\n‘Tell me, what is your name? … and where do you live?’ \\nshe said hurriedly in a breathless voice.\\nHe laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her \\nwith a sort of rapture. It was such a joy to him to look at her, \\nhe could not have said why.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf64a0\\n‘Who sent you?’\\n‘Sister Sonia sent me,’ answered the girl, smiling still \\nmore brightly.\\n‘I knew it was sister Sonia sent you.’\\n‘Mamma sent me, too … when sister Sonia was sending \\nme, mamma came up, too, and said ‘Run fast, Polenka.’’\\n‘Do you love sister Sonia?’\\n‘I love her more than anyone,’ Polenka answered with a \\npeculiar earnestness, and her smile became graver.\\n‘And will you love me?’\\nBy way of answer he saw the little girl’s face approaching \\nhim, her full lips naïvely held out to kiss him. Suddenly her \\narms as thin as sticks held him tightly, her head rested on \\nhis shoulder and the little girl wept softly, pressing her face \\nagainst him.\\n‘I am sorry for father,’ she said a moment later, raising \\nher tear- stained face and brushing away the tears with her \\nhands. ‘It’s nothing but misfortunes now,’ she added sud-\\ndenly with that peculiarly sedate air which children try hard \\nto assume when they want to speak like grown-up people.\\n‘Did your father love you?’\\n‘He loved Lida most,’ she went on very seriously without \\na smile, exactly like grown-up people, ‘he loved her be-\\ncause she is little and because she is ill, too. And he always \\nused to bring her presents. But he taught us to read and me \\ngrammar and scripture, too,’ she added with dignity. ‘And \\nmother never used to say anything, but we knew that she \\nliked it and father knew it, too. And mother wants to teach \\nme French, for it’s time my education began.’\\n\\uf645\\uf64a1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘And do you know your prayers?’\\n‘Of course, we do! We knew them long ago. I say my \\nprayers to myself as I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida \\nsay them aloud with mother. First they repeat the ‘Ave Ma-\\nria’ and then another prayer: ‘Lord, forgive and bless sister \\nSonia,’ and then another, ‘Lord, forgive and bless our sec-\\nond father.’ For our elder father is dead and this is another \\none, but we do pray for the other as well.’\\n‘Polenka, my name is Rodion. Pray sometimes for me, \\ntoo. ‘And Thy servant Rodion,’ nothing more.’\\n‘I’ll pray for you all the rest of my life,’ the little girl de-\\nclared hotly, and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him \\nand hugged him warmly once more.\\nRaskolnikov told her his name and address and prom-\\nised to be sure to come next day. The child went away quite \\nenchanted with him. It was past ten when he came out into \\nthe street. In five minutes he was standing on the bridge at \\nthe spot where the woman had jumped in.',\n",
              " '‘Enough,’ he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly. \\n‘I’ve done with fancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms! \\nLife is real! haven’t I lived just now? My life has not yet died \\nwith that old woman! The Kingdom of Heaven to her—and \\nnow enough, madam, leave me in peace! Now for the reign \\nof reason and light … and of will, and of strength … and \\nnow we will see! We will try our strength!’ he added defi-\\nantly, as though challenging some power of darkness. ‘And \\nI was ready to consent to live in a square of space!\\n‘I am very weak at this moment, but … I believe my ill-\\nness is all over. I knew it would be over when I went out. \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf64a\\uf645\\nBy the way, Potchinkov’s house is only a few steps away. I \\ncertainly must go to Razumihin even if it were not close \\nby … let him win his bet! Let us give him some satisfaction, \\ntoo—no matter! Strength, strength is what one wants, you \\ncan get nothing without it, and strength must be won by \\nstrength—that’s what they don’t know,’ he added proudly \\nand self-confidently and he walked with flagging footsteps \\nfrom the bridge. Pride and self-confidence grew continu-\\nally stronger in him; he was becoming a different man every \\nmoment. What was it had happened to work this revolution \\nin him? He did not know himself; like a man catching at a \\nstraw, he suddenly felt that he, too, ‘could live, that there \\nwas still life for him, that his life had not died with the old \\nwoman.’ Perhaps he was in too great a hurry with his con-\\nclusions, but he did not think of that.\\n‘But I did ask her to remember ‘Thy servant Rodion’ in \\nher prayers,’ the idea struck him. ‘Well, that was … in case \\nof emergency,’ he added and laughed himself at his boyish \\nsally. He was in the best of spirits.\\nHe easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already \\nknown at Potchinkov’s and the porter at once showed him \\nthe way. Half-way upstairs he could hear the noise and ani-\\nmated conversation of a big gathering of people. The door \\nwas wide open on the stairs; he could hear exclamations and \\ndiscussion. Razumihin’s room was fairly large; the company \\nconsisted of fifteen people. Raskolnikov stopped in the en-\\ntry, where two of the landlady’s servants were busy behind \\na screen with two samovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie \\nand savouries, brought up from the landlady’s kitchen. Ras-\\n\\uf645\\uf64a\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nkolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He ran out delighted. At \\nthe first glance it was apparent that he had had a great deal \\nto drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin \\nquite drunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it.\\n‘Listen,’ Raskolnikov hastened to say, ‘I’ve only just come \\nto tell you you’ve won your bet and that no one really knows \\nwhat may not happen to him. I can’t come in; I am so weak \\nthat I shall fall down directly. And so good evening and \\ngood-bye! Come and see me to-morrow.’\\n‘Do you know what? I’ll see you home. If you say you’re \\nweak yourself, you must …’\\n‘And your visitors? Who is the curly-headed one who has \\njust peeped out?’\\n‘He? Goodness only knows! Some friend of uncle’s, I ex-\\npect, or perhaps he has come without being invited … I’ll \\nleave uncle with them, he is an invaluable person, pity I \\ncan’t introduce you to him now. But confound them all \\nnow! They won’t notice me, and I need a little fresh air, for \\nyou’ve come just in the nick of time—another two minutes \\nand I should have come to blows! They are talking such a lot \\nof wild stuff … you simply can’t imagine what men will say! \\nThough why shouldn’t you imagine? Don’t we talk nonsense \\nourselves? And let them … that’s the way to learn not to! … \\nWait a minute, I’ll fetch Zossimov.’\\nZossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; \\nhe showed a special interest in him; soon his face bright-\\nened.\\n‘You must go to bed at once,’ he pronounced, examining \\nthe patient as far as he could, ‘and take something for the \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf64a\\uf647\\nnight. Will you take it? I got it ready some time ago … a \\npowder.’\\n‘Two, if you like,’ answered Raskolnikov. The powder was \\ntaken at once.\\n‘It’s a good thing you are taking him home,’ observed \\nZossimov to Razumihin—‘we shall see how he is to-mor-\\nrow, to-day he’s not at all amiss—a considerable change \\nsince the afternoon. Live and learn …’\\n‘Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we \\nwere coming out?’ Razumihin blurted out, as soon as they \\nwere in the street. ‘I won’t tell you everything, brother, be-\\ncause they are such fools. Zossimov told me to talk freely to \\nyou on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and after-\\nwards I am to tell him about it, for he’s got a notion in his \\nhead that you are … mad or close on it. Only fancy! In the \\nfirst place, you’ve three times the brains he has; in the sec-\\nond, if you are not mad, you needn’t care a hang that he has \\ngot such a wild idea; and thirdly, that piece of beef whose \\nspecialty is surgery has gone mad on mental diseases, and \\nwhat’s brought him to this conclusion about you was your \\nconversation to-day with Zametov.’\\n‘Zametov told you all about it?’\\n‘Yes, and he did well. Now I understand what it all means \\nand so does Zametov…. Well, the fact is, Rodya … the point \\nis … I am a little drunk now….',\n",
              " 'But that’s … no matter … \\nthe point is that this idea … you understand? was just be-\\ning hatched in their brains … you understand?

But why are they such fools? I gave \\nZametov a bit of a thrashing at the time— that’s between \\nourselves, brother; please don’t let out a hint that you know \\nof it; I’ve noticed he is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise \\nIvanovna’s. But to-day, to-day it’s all cleared up. That Ilya \\nPetrovitch is at the bottom of it! He took advantage of your \\nfainting at the police station, but he is ashamed of it himself \\nnow; I know that …’\\nRaskolnikov listened greedily. Razumihin was drunk \\nenough to talk too freely.\\n‘I fainted then because it was so close and the smell of \\npaint,’ said Raskolnikov.\\n‘No need to explain that! And it wasn’t the paint only: \\nthe fever had been coming on for a month; Zossimov testi-\\nfies to that! But how crushed that boy is now, you wouldn’t \\nbelieve! ‘I am not worth his little finger,’ he says. Yours, he \\nmeans. He has good feelings at times, brother. But the les-\\nson, the lesson you gave him to-day in the Palais de Cristal, \\nthat was too good for anything! You frightened him at first, \\nyou know, he nearly went into convulsions! You almost con-\\nvinced him again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense, \\nand then you suddenly—put out your tongue at him: ‘There \\nnow, what do you make of it?’ It was perfect! He is crushed, \\nannihilated now! It was masterly, by Jove, it’s what they \\ndeserve! Ah, that I wasn’t there! He was hoping to see you \\nawfully. Porfiry, too, wants to make your acquaintance …’\\n‘Ah! … he too … but why did they put me down as mad?’\\n‘Oh, not mad. I must have said too much, brother…. \\nWhat struck him, you see, was that only that subject seemed \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf64a\\uf649\\nto interest you; now it’s clear why it did interest you; know-\\ning all the circumstances … and how that irritated you and \\nworked in with your illness … I am a little drunk, brother, \\nonly, confound him, he has some idea of his own … I tell \\nyou, he’s mad on mental diseases. But don’t you mind him \\n…’\\nFor half a minute both were silent.\\n‘Listen, Razumihin,’ began Raskolnikov, ‘I want to tell \\nyou plainly: I’ve just been at a death-bed, a clerk who died \\n… I gave them all my money … and besides I’ve just been \\nkissed by someone who, if I had killed anyone, would just \\nthe same … in fact I saw someone else there … with a flame-\\ncoloured feather … but I am talking nonsense; I am very \\nweak, support me … we shall be at the stairs directly …’\\n‘What’s the matter? What’s the matter with you?’ Razu-\\nmihin asked anxiously.\\n‘I am a little giddy, but that’s not the point, I am so sad, so \\nsad … like a woman. Look, what’s that? Look, look!’\\n‘What is it?’\\n‘Don’t you see? A light in my room, you see? Through the \\ncrack …’\\nThey were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs, at \\nthe level of the landlady’s door, and they could, as a fact, see \\nfrom below that there was a light in Raskolnikov’s garret.\\n‘Queer! Nastasya, perhaps,’ observed Razumihin.\\n‘She is never in my room at this time and she must be in \\nbed long ago, but … I don’t care! Good-bye!’\\n‘What do you mean? I am coming with you, we’ll come \\nin together!’\\n\\uf645\\uf64a\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘I know we are going in together, but I want to shake \\nhands here and say good-bye to you here. So give me your \\nhand, good-bye!’\\n‘What’s the matter with you, Rodya?’\\n‘Nothing … come along … you shall be witness.’\\nThey began mounting the stairs, and the idea struck Ra-\\nzumihin that perhaps Zossimov might be right after all. ‘Ah, \\nI’ve upset him with my chatter!’ he muttered to himself.\\nWhen they reached the door they heard voices in the \\nroom.\\n‘What is it?’ cried Razumihin. Raskolnikov was the first \\nto open the door; he flung it wide and stood still in the door-\\nway, dumbfoundered.\\nHis mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had \\nbeen waiting an hour and a half for him. Why had he never \\nexpected, never thought of them, though the news that they \\nhad started, were on their way and would arrive immediate-\\nly, had been repeated to him only that day? They had spent \\nthat hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions. She \\nwas standing before them and had told them everything by \\nnow. They were beside themselves with alarm when they \\nheard of his ‘running away’ to-day, ill and, as they under-\\nstood from her story, delirious! ‘Good Heavens, what had \\nbecome of him?’ Both had been weeping, both had been in \\nanguish for that hour and a half.\\nA cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted Raskolnikov’s entrance. \\nBoth rushed to him.

Only just now the doctor said \\nhe was much better, that he is perfectly well! Water!

              " 'They had heard already \\nfrom Nastasya all that had been done for their Rodya during \\nhis illness, by this ‘very competent young man,’ as Pulche-\\nria Alexandrovna Raskolnikov called him that evening in \\nconversation with Dounia.\\n\\uf645\\uf64a\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nPart III\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf64b0\\nChapter I\\nR\\naskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa. He waved \\nhis hand weakly to Razumihin to cut short the flow of \\nwarm and incoherent consolations he was addressing to his \\nmother and sister, took them both by the hand and for a \\nminute or two gazed from one to the other without speak-\\ning. His mother was alarmed by his expression. It revealed \\nan emotion agonisingly poignant, and at the same time \\nsomething immovable, almost insane. Pulcheria Alexan-\\ndrovna began to cry.\\nAvdotya Romanovna was pale; her hand trembled in her \\nbrother’s.\\n‘Go home … with him,’ he said in a broken voice, point-\\ning to Razumihin, ‘good-bye till to-morrow; to-morrow \\neverything … Is it long since you arrived?’\\n‘This evening, Rodya,’ answered Pulcheria Alexandrov-\\nna, ‘the train was awfully late. But, Rodya, nothing would \\ninduce me to leave you now! I will spend the night here, \\nnear you …’\\n‘Don’t torture me!’ he said with a gesture of irritation.\\n‘I will stay with him,’ cried Razumihin, ‘I won’t leave him \\nfor a moment. Bother all my visitors! Let them rage to their \\nhearts’ content! My uncle is presiding there.’\\n‘How, how can I thank you!’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna \\nwas beginning, once more pressing Razumihin’s hands, but \\n\\uf645\\uf64b1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nRaskolnikov interrupted her again.\\n‘I can’t have it! I can’t have it!’ he repeated irritably, ‘don’t \\nworry me! Enough, go away … I can’t stand it!’\\n‘Come, mamma, come out of the room at least for a min-\\nute,’ Dounia whispered in dismay; ‘we are distressing him, \\nthat’s evident.’\\n‘Mayn’t I look at him after three years?’ wept Pulcheria \\nAlexandrovna.\\n‘Stay,’ he stopped them again, ‘you keep interrupting me, \\nand my ideas get muddled…. Have you seen Luzhin?’\\n‘No, Rodya, but he knows already of our arrival. We have \\nheard, Rodya, that Pyotr Petrovitch was so kind as to visit \\nyou today,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna added somewhat tim-\\nidly.\\n‘Yes … he was so kind … Dounia, I promised Luzhin I’d \\nthrow him downstairs and told him to go to hell….’\\n‘Rodya, what are you saying! Surely, you don’t mean to \\ntell us …’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm, but she \\nstopped, looking at Dounia.\\nAvdotya Romanovna was looking attentively at her \\nbrother, waiting for what would come next. Both of them \\nhad heard of the quarrel from Nastasya, so far as she had \\nsucceeded in understanding and reporting it, and were in \\npainful perplexity and suspense.\\n‘Dounia,’ Raskolnikov continued with an effort, ‘I don’t \\nwant that marriage, so at the first opportunity to-morrow \\nyou must refuse Luzhin, so that we may never hear his \\nname again.’\\n‘Good Heavens!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf64b\\uf645\\n‘Brother, think what you are saying!’ Avdotya Romanov-\\nna began impetuously, but immediately checked herself. \\n‘You are not fit to talk now, perhaps; you are tired,’ she add-\\ned gently.\\n‘You think I am delirious? No … You are marrying Lu-\\nzhin for my sake. But I won’t accept the sacrifice. And so \\nwrite a letter before to-morrow, to refuse him … Let me \\nread it in the morning and that will be the end of it!’\\n‘That I can’t do!’ the girl cried, offended, ‘what right have \\nyou …’\\n‘Dounia, you are hasty, too, be quiet, to-morrow … Don’t \\nyou see …’ the mother interposed in dismay. ‘Better come \\naway!’\\n‘He is raving,’ Razumihin cried tipsily, ‘or how would he \\ndare! To-morrow all this nonsense will be over … to-day he \\ncertainly did drive him away. That was so. And Luzhin got \\nangry, too…. He made speeches here, wanted to show off \\nhis learning and he went out crest- fallen….’\\n‘Then it’s true?’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n‘Good-bye till to-morrow, brother,’ said Dounia compas-\\nsionately—‘let us go, mother … Good-bye, Rodya.’\\n‘Do you hear, sister,’ he repeated after them, making a last \\neffort, ‘I am not delirious; this marriage is—an infamy. Let \\nme act like a scoundrel, but you mustn’t … one is enough … \\nand though I am a scoundrel, I wouldn’t own such a sister. \\nIt’s me or Luzhin! Go now….’\\n‘But you’re out of your mind!

              " 'He lay down on the sofa, and turned to the wall, utterly \\n\\uf645\\uf64b\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nexhausted. Avdotya Romanovna looked with interest at \\nRazumihin; her black eyes flashed; Razumihin positively \\nstarted at her glance.\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed.\\n‘Nothing would induce me to go,’ she whispered in de-\\nspair to Razumihin. ‘I will stay somewhere here … escort \\nDounia home.’\\n‘You’ll spoil everything,’ Razumihin answered in the \\nsame whisper, losing patience—‘come out on to the stairs, \\nanyway. Nastasya, show a light! I assure you,’ he went on \\nin a half whisper on the stairs- ‘that he was almost beat-\\ning the doctor and me this afternoon! Do you understand? \\nThe doctor himself! Even he gave way and left him, so as \\nnot to irritate him. I remained downstairs on guard, but he \\ndressed at once and slipped off. And he will slip off again if \\nyou irritate him, at this time of night, and will do himself \\nsome mischief….’\\n‘What are you saying?’\\n‘And Avdotya Romanovna can’t possibly be left in those \\nlodgings without you. Just think where you are staying! That \\nblackguard Pyotr Petrovitch couldn’t find you better lodg-\\nings … But you know I’ve had a little to drink, and that’s \\nwhat makes me … swear; don’t mind it….’\\n‘But I’ll go to the landlady here,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna \\ninsisted, ‘Ill beseech her to find some corner for Dounia and \\nme for the night. I can’t leave him like that, I cannot!’\\nThis conversation took place on the landing just before \\nthe landlady’s door. Nastasya lighted them from a step be-\\nlow. Razumihin was in extraordinary excitement. Half an \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf64b\\uf647\\nhour earlier, while he was bringing Raskolnikov home, he \\nhad indeed talked too freely, but he was aware of it himself, \\nand his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he had \\nimbibed. Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all \\nthat he had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled \\neffect. He stood with the two ladies, seizing both by their \\nhands, persuading them, and giving them reasons with as-\\ntonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every word he \\nuttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed \\ntheir hands painfully as in a vise. He stared at Avdotya Ro-\\nmanovna without the least regard for good manners. They \\nsometimes pulled their hands out of his huge bony paws, \\nbut far from noticing what was the matter, he drew them all \\nthe closer to him. If they’d told him to jump head foremost \\nfrom the staircase, he would have done it without thought \\nor hesitation in their service. Though Pulcheria Alexan-\\ndrovna felt that the young man was really too eccentric and \\npinched her hand too much, in her anxiety over her Rodya \\nshe looked on his presence as providential, and was un-\\nwilling to notice all his peculiarities. But though Avdotya \\nRomanovna shared her anxiety, and was not of timorous \\ndisposition, she could not see the glowing light in his eyes \\nwithout wonder and almost alarm. It was only the un-\\nbounded confidence inspired by Nastasya’s account of her \\nbrother’s queer friend, which prevented her from trying to \\nrun away from him, and to persuade her mother to do the \\nsame. She realised, too, that even running away was per-\\nhaps impossible now. Ten minutes later, however, she was \\nconsiderably reassured; it was characteristic of Razumihin \\n\\uf645\\uf64b\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthat he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he \\nmight be in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they \\nhad to deal with.\\n‘You can’t go to the landlady, that’s perfect nonsense!’ he \\ncried. ‘If you stay, though you are his mother, you’ll drive \\nhim to a frenzy, and then goodness knows what will hap-\\npen! Listen, I’ll tell you what I’ll do: Nastasya will stay with \\nhim now, and I’ll conduct you both home, you can’t be in \\nthe streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in that way…. \\nBut no matter! Then I’ll run straight back here and a quarter \\nof an hour later, on my word of honour, I’ll bring you news \\nhow he is, whether he is asleep, and all that. Then, listen! \\nThen I’ll run home in a twinkling—I’ve a lot of friends there, \\nall drunk—I’ll fetch Zossimov—that’s the doctor who is \\nlooking after him, he is there, too, but he is not drunk; he is \\nnot drunk, he is never drunk! I’ll drag him to Rodya, and \\nthen to you, so that you’ll get two reports in the hour—from \\nthe doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, that’s \\na very different thing from my account of him! If there’s \\nanything wrong, I swear I’ll bring you here myself, but, if \\nit’s all right, you go to bed. And I’ll spend the night here, in \\nthe passage, he won’t hear me, and I’ll tell Zossimov to sleep \\nat the landlady’s, to be at hand. Which is better for him: you \\nor the doctor? So come home then! But the landlady is out of \\nthe question; it’s all right for me, but it’s out of the question \\nfor you: she wouldn’t take you, for she’s … for she’s a fool … \\nShe’d be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and \\nof you, too, if you want to know … of Avdotya Romanov-\\nna certainly. She is an absolutely, absolutely unaccountable \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf64b\\uf649\\ncharacter! But I am a fool, too! … No matter! Come along! \\nDo you trust me? Come, do you trust me or not?’\\n‘Let us go, mother,’ said Avdotya Romanovna, ‘he will \\ncertainly do what he has promised. He has saved Rodya \\nalready, and if the doctor really will consent to spend the \\nnight here, what could be better?’\\n‘You see, you … you … understand me, because you are \\nan angel!’ Razumihin cried in ecstasy, ‘let us go! Nasta-\\nsya! Fly upstairs and sit with him with a light; I’ll come in a \\nquarter of an hour.’\\nThough Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly con-\\nvinced, she made no further resistance. Razumihin gave an \\narm to each and drew them down the stairs. He still made \\nher uneasy, as though he was competent and good-natured, \\nwas he capable of carrying out his promise? He seemed in \\nsuch a condition….\\n‘Ah, I see you think I am in such a condition!’ Razumihin \\nbroke in upon her thoughts, guessing them, as he strolled \\nalong the pavement with huge steps, so that the two ladies \\ncould hardly keep up with him, a fact he did not observe, \\nhowever.',\n",

That’s what they regard as the high-\\nest point of progress. If only their nonsense were their own, \\nbut as it is …’\\n‘Listen!’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna interrupted timidly, \\nbut it only added fuel to the flames.\\n‘What do you think?’ shouted Razumihin, louder than \\never, ‘you think I am attacking them for talking nonsense? \\nNot a bit!

Give me your hand … you give me yours, \\ntoo!

We can depend \\non him, I assure you. And all that he has done for Ro-\\ndya….’\\n‘Ah. Dounia, goodness knows whether he will come! \\nHow could I bring myself to leave Rodya? … And how dif-\\nferent, how different I had fancied our meeting!

What will happen, what will happen? \\n\\uf645\\uf64c1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nAnd how he talked to you, Dounia!’ said the mother, look-\\ning timidly at her daughter, trying to read her thoughts \\nand, already half consoled by Dounia’s standing up for her \\nbrother, which meant that she had already forgiven him. ‘I \\nam sure he will think better of it to-morrow,’ she added, \\nprobing her further.\\n‘And I am sure that he will say the same to-morrow … \\nabout that,’ Avdotya Romanovna said finally. And, of course, \\nthere was no going beyond that, for this was a point which \\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was afraid to discuss. Dounia went \\nup and kissed her mother. The latter warmly embraced her \\nwithout speaking. Then she sat down to wait anxiously for \\nRazumihin’s return, timidly watching her daughter who \\nwalked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in \\nthought. This walking up and down when she was thinking \\nwas a habit of Avdotya Romanovna’s and the mother was \\nalways afraid to break in on her daughter’s mood at such \\nmoments.\\nRazumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his sudden \\ndrunken infatuation for Avdotya Romanovna. Yet apart \\nfrom his eccentric condition, many people would have \\nthought it justified if they had seen Avdotya Romanov-\\nna, especially at that moment when she was walking to \\nand fro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy. Av-\\ndotya Romanovna was remarkably good looking; she was \\ntall, strikingly well-proportioned, strong and self-reliant—\\nthe latter quality was apparent in every gesture, though \\nit did not in the least detract from the grace and softness \\nof her movements. In face she resembled her brother, but \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf64c\\uf645\\nshe might be described as really beautiful. Her hair was \\ndark brown, a little lighter than her brother’s; there was \\na proud light in her almost black eyes and yet at times a \\nlook of extraordinary kindness.',\n",
              " 'She was pale, but it was \\na healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness and \\nvigour. Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip \\nprojected a little as did her chin; it was the only irregular-\\nity in her beautiful face, but it gave it a peculiarly individual \\nand almost haughty expression. Her face was always more \\nserious and thoughtful than gay; but how well smiles, how \\nwell youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible, laughter suited \\nher face! It was natural enough that a warm, open, simple-\\nhearted, honest giant like Razumihin, who had never seen \\nanyone like her and was not quite sober at the time, should \\nlose his head immediately. Besides, as chance would have it, \\nhe saw Dounia for the first time transfigured by her love for \\nher brother and her joy at meeting him. Afterwards he saw \\nher lower lip quiver with indignation at her brother’s inso-\\nlent, cruel and ungrateful words—and his fate was sealed.\\nHe had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out \\nin his drunken talk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, \\nRaskolnikov’s eccentric landlady, would be jealous of Pul-\\ncheria Alexandrovna as well as of Avdotya Romanovna on \\nhis account. Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was forty-\\nthree, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she \\nlooked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost \\nalways the case with women who retain serenity of spirit, \\nsensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart to old age. \\nWe may add in parenthesis that to preserve all this is the \\n\\uf645\\uf64c\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nonly means of retaining beauty to old age. Her hair had be-\\ngun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow’s \\nfoot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and \\nsunken from anxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome \\nface. She was Dounia over again, twenty years older, but \\nwithout the projecting underlip. Pulcheria Alexandrovna \\nwas emotional, but not sentimental, timid and yielding, \\nbut only to a certain point. She could give way and accept \\na great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, \\nbut there was a certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle \\nand the deepest convictions which nothing would induce \\nher to cross.\\nExactly twenty minutes after Razumihin’s departure, \\nthere came two subdued but hurried knocks at the door: he \\nhad come back.\\n‘I won’t come in, I haven’t time,’ he hastened to say when \\nthe door was opened. ‘He sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, \\nand God grant he may sleep ten hours. Nastasya’s with him; \\nI told her not to leave till I came. Now I am fetching Zos-\\nsimov, he will report to you and then you’d better turn in; I \\ncan see you are too tired to do anything….’\\nAnd he ran off down the corridor.\\n‘What a very competent and … devoted young man!’ \\ncried Pulcheria Alexandrovna exceedingly delighted.\\n‘He seems a splendid person!’ Avdotya Romanovna re-\\nplied with some warmth, resuming her walk up and down \\nthe room.\\nIt was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps \\nin the corridor and another knock at the door. Both wom-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf64c\\uf647\\nen waited this time completely relying on Razumihin’s \\npromise; he actually had succeeded in bringing Zossimov. \\nZossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party \\nto go to Raskolnikov’s, but he came reluctantly and with \\nthe greatest suspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razu-\\nmihin in his exhilarated condition. But his vanity was at \\nonce reassured and flattered; he saw that they were really \\nexpecting him as an oracle. He stayed just ten minutes and \\nsucceeded in completely convincing and comforting Pul-\\ncheria Alexandrovna. He spoke with marked sympathy, but \\nwith the reserve and extreme seriousness of a young doctor \\nat an important consultation. He did not utter a word on \\nany other subject and did not display the slightest desire to \\nenter into more personal relations with the two ladies. Re-\\nmarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya \\nRomanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during \\nhis visit and addressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexan-\\ndrovna. All this gave him extraordinary inward satisfaction. \\nHe declared that he thought the invalid at this moment go-\\ning on very satisfactorily. According to his observations the \\npatient’s illness was due partly to his unfortunate material \\nsurroundings during the last few months, but it had partly \\nalso a moral origin, ‘was, so to speak, the product of sever-\\nal material and moral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, \\ntroubles, certain ideas … and so on.’ Noticing stealthily that \\nAvdotya Romanovna was following his words with close at-\\ntention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this theme. \\nOn Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s anxiously and timidly in-\\nquiring as to ‘some suspicion of insanity,’ he replied with \\n\\uf645\\uf64c\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\na composed and candid smile that his words had been ex-\\naggerated; that certainly the patient had some fixed idea, \\nsomething approaching a monomania—he, Zossimov, was \\nnow particularly studying this interesting branch of medi-\\ncine—but that it must be recollected that until to-day the \\npatient had been in delirium and … and that no doubt the \\npresence of his family would have a favourable effect on his \\nrecovery and distract his mind, ‘if only all fresh shocks can \\nbe avoided,’ he added significantly. Then he got up, took \\nleave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, \\nwarm gratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, \\nand Avdotya Romanovna spontaneously offered her hand \\nto him. He went out exceedingly pleased with his visit and \\nstill more so with himself.\\n‘We’ll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!’ Razumihin \\nsaid in conclusion, following Zossimov out. ‘I’ll be with you \\nto-morrow morning as early as possible with my report.’\\n‘That’s a fetching little girl, Avdotya Romanovna,’ re-\\nmarked Zossimov, almost licking his lips as they both came \\nout into the street.',\n",
              " '‘Fetching? You said fetching?’ roared Razumihin and he \\nflew at Zossimov and seized him by the throat. ‘If you ever \\ndare…. Do you understand? Do you understand?’ he shout-\\ned, shaking him by the collar and squeezing him against \\nthe wall. ‘Do you hear?’\\n‘Let me go, you drunken devil,’ said Zossimov, strug-\\ngling and when he had let him go, he stared at him and went \\noff into a sudden guffaw. Razumihin stood facing him in \\ngloomy and earnest reflection.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf64c\\uf649\\n‘Of course, I am an ass,’ he observed, sombre as a storm \\ncloud, ‘but still … you are another.’\\n‘No, brother, not at all such another. I am not dreaming \\nof any folly.’\\nThey walked along in silence and only when they were \\nclose to Raskolnikov’s lodgings, Razumihin broke the si-\\nlence in considerable anxiety.\\n‘Listen,’ he said, ‘you’re a first-rate fellow, but among your \\nother failings, you’re a loose fish, that I know, and a dirty \\none, too. You are a feeble, nervous wretch, and a mass of \\nwhims, you’re getting fat and lazy and can’t deny yourself \\nanything—and I call that dirty because it leads one straight \\ninto the dirt. You’ve let yourself get so slack that I don’t \\nknow how it is you are still a good, even a devoted doctor. \\nYou—a doctor—sleep on a feather bed and get up at night \\nto your patients! In another three or four years you won’t \\nget up for your patients … But hang it all, that’s not the \\npoint! … You are going to spend to-night in the landlady’s \\nflat here. (Hard work I’ve had to persuade her!) And I’ll be \\nin the kitchen. So here’s a chance for you to get to know her \\nbetter…. It’s not as you think! There’s not a trace of any-\\nthing of the sort, brother …!’\\n‘But I don’t think!’\\n‘Here you have modesty, brother, silence, bashfulness, a \\nsavage virtue … and yet she’s sighing and melting like wax, \\nsimply melting! Save me from her, by all that’s unholy! She’s \\nmost prepossessing … I’ll repay you, I’ll do anything….’\\nZossimov laughed more violently than ever.\\n‘Well, you are smitten! But what am I to do with her?’\\n\\uf645\\uf64c\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘It won’t be much trouble, I assure you. Talk any rot you \\nlike to her, as long as you sit by her and talk. You’re a doctor, \\ntoo; try curing her of something. I swear you won’t regret it. \\nShe has a piano, and you know, I strum a little. I have a song \\nthere, a genuine Russian one: ‘I shed hot tears.’ She likes the \\ngenuine article—and well, it all began with that song; Now \\nyou’re a regular performer, a maître a Rubinstein…. I assure \\nyou, you won’t regret it!’\\n‘But have you made her some promise? Something \\nsigned? A promise of marriage, perhaps?’\\n‘Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of the kind! Be-\\nsides she is not that sort at all…. Tchebarov tried that….’\\n‘Well then, drop her!’\\n‘But I can’t drop her like that!’\\n‘Why can’t you?’\\n‘Well, I can’t, that’s all about it! There’s an element of at-\\ntraction here, brother.’\\n‘Then why have you fascinated her?’\\n‘I haven’t fascinated her; perhaps I was fascinated my-\\nself in my folly. But she won’t care a straw whether it’s you \\nor I, so long as somebody sits beside her, sighing…. I can’t \\nexplain the position, brother … look here, you are good at \\nmathematics, and working at it now … begin teaching her \\nthe integral calculus; upon my soul, I’m not joking, I’m in \\nearnest, it’ll be just the same to her. She will gaze at you and \\nsigh for a whole year together. I talked to her once for two \\ndays at a time about the Prussian House of Lords (for one \\nmust talk of something)—she just sighed and perspired! \\nAnd you mustn’t talk of love—she’s bashful to hysterics—\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf645\\uf64c\\uf64b\\nbut just let her see you can’t tear yourself away—that’s \\nenough. It’s fearfully comfortable; you’re quite at home, you \\ncan read, sit, lie about, write. You may even venture on a \\nkiss, if you’re careful.’\\n‘But what do I want with her?’\\n‘Ach, I can’t make you understand! You see, you are made \\nfor each other! I have often been reminded of you! … You’ll \\ncome to it in the end! So does it matter whether it’s sooner \\nor later? There’s the feather-bed element here, brother—ach! \\nand not only that! There’s an attraction here—here you have \\nthe end of the world, an anchorage, a quiet haven, the na-\\nvel of the earth, the three fishes that are the foundation of \\nthe world, the essence of pancakes, of savoury fish- pies, of \\nthe evening samovar, of soft sighs and warm shawls, and \\nhot stoves to sleep on—as snug as though you were dead, \\nand yet you’re alive—the advantages of both at once! Well, \\nhang it, brother, what stuff I’m talking, it’s bedtime! Listen. \\nI sometimes wake up at night; so I’ll go in and look at him. \\nBut there’s no need, it’s all right. Don’t you worry yourself, \\nyet if you like, you might just look in once, too. But if you \\nnotice anything—delirium or fever—wake me at once.',\n",
              " 'But \\nthere can’t be….’\\n\\uf645\\uf64c\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter II\\nR\\nazumihin waked up next morning at eight o’clock, \\ntroubled and serious. He found himself confronted \\nwith many new and unlooked-for perplexities. He had nev-\\ner expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that. He \\nremembered every detail of the previous day and he knew \\nthat a perfectly novel experience had befallen him, that he \\nhad received an impression unlike anything he had known \\nbefore. At the same time he recognised clearly that the \\ndream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly un-\\nattainable—so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed \\nof it, and he hastened to pass to the other more practical \\ncares and difficulties bequeathed him by that ‘thrice ac-\\ncursed yesterday.’\\nThe most awful recollection of the previous day was the \\nway he had shown himself ‘base and mean,’ not only because \\nhe had been drunk, but because he had taken advantage of \\nthe young girl’s position to abuse her fiancé in his stupid \\njealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual relations and ob-\\nligations and next to nothing of the man himself. And what \\nright had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded \\nmanner? Who had asked for his opinion? Was it think-\\nable that such a creature as Avdotya Romanovna would be \\nmarrying an unworthy man for money? So there must be \\nsomething in him. The lodgings? But after all how could he \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64600\\nknow the character of the lodgings? He was furnishing a flat \\n… Foo! how despicable it all was! And what justification was \\nit that he was drunk? Such a stupid excuse was even more \\ndegrading! In wine is truth, and the truth had all come out, \\n‘that is, all the uncleanness of his coarse and envious heart’! \\nAnd would such a dream ever be permissible to him, Razu-\\nmihin? What was he beside such a girl—he, the drunken \\nnoisy braggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so \\nabsurd and cynical a juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed \\ndesperately at the very idea and suddenly the recollection \\nforced itself vividly upon him of how he had said last night \\non the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of Avdotya \\nRomanovna … that was simply intolerable. He brought his \\nfist down heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and \\nsent one of the bricks flying.\\n‘Of course,’ he muttered to himself a minute later with a \\nfeeling of self-abasement, ‘of course, all these infamies can \\nnever be wiped out or smoothed over … and so it’s useless \\neven to think of it, and I must go to them in silence and do \\nmy duty … in silence, too … and not ask forgiveness, and \\nsay nothing … for all is lost now!’\\nAnd yet as he dressed he examined his attire more care-\\nfully than usual. He hadn’t another suit—if he had had, \\nperhaps he wouldn’t have put it on. ‘I would have made a \\npoint of not putting it on.’ But in any case he could not re-\\nmain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend \\nthe feelings of others, especially when they were in need of \\nhis assistance and asking him to see them. He brushed his \\nclothes carefully. His linen was always decent; in that re-\\n\\uf64601\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nspect he was especially clean.\\nHe washed that morning scrupulously—he got some \\nsoap from Nastasya— he washed his hair, his neck and es-\\npecially his hands. When it came to the question whether \\nto shave his stubbly chin or not (Praskovya Pavlovna had \\ncapital razors that had been left by her late husband), the \\nquestion was angrily answered in the negative. ‘Let it stay as \\nit is! What if they think that I shaved on purpose to …? They \\ncertainly would think so! Not on any account!’\\n‘And … the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he \\nhad the manners of a pothouse; and … and even admitting \\nthat he knew he had some of the essentials of a gentleman \\n… what was there in that to be proud of? Everyone ought to \\nbe a gentleman and more than that … and all the same (he \\nremembered) he, too, had done little things … not exact-\\nly dishonest, and yet…. And what thoughts he sometimes \\nhad; hm … and to set all that beside Avdotya Romanovna! \\nConfound it! So be it! Well, he’d make a point then of be-\\ning dirty, greasy, pothouse in his manners and he wouldn’t \\ncare! He’d be worse!’\\nHe was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov, \\nwho had spent the night in Praskovya Pavlovna’s parlour, \\ncame in.\\nHe was going home and was in a hurry to look at the in-\\nvalid first. Razumihin informed him that Raskolnikov was \\nsleeping like a dormouse. Zossimov gave orders that they \\nshouldn’t wake him and promised to see him again about \\neleven.\\n‘If he is still at home,’ he added. ‘Damn it all! If one can’t \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6460\\uf645\\ncontrol one’s patients, how is one to cure them? Do you \\nknow whether he will go to them, or whether they are com-\\ning here?’\\n‘They are coming, I think,’ said Razumihin, understand-\\ning the object of the question, ‘and they will discuss their \\nfamily affairs, no doubt. I’ll be off. You, as the doctor, have \\nmore right to be here than I.’\\n‘But I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; \\nI’ve plenty to do besides looking after them.’\\n‘One thing worries me,’ interposed Razumihin, frown-\\ning. ‘On the way home I talked a lot of drunken nonsense \\nto him … all sorts of things … and amongst them that you \\nwere afraid that he … might become insane.’\\n‘You told the ladies so, too.’\\n‘I know it was stupid! You may beat me if you like! Did \\nyou think so seriously?’\\n‘That’s nonsense, I tell you, how could I think it serious-\\nly? You, yourself, described him as a monomaniac when \\nyou fetched me to him … and we added fuel to the fire yes-\\nterday, you did, that is, with your story about the painter; it \\nwas a nice conversation, when he was, perhaps, mad on that \\nvery point! If only I’d known what happened then at the \\npolice station and that some wretch … had insulted him \\nwith this suspicion! Hm … I would not have allowed that \\nconversation yesterday. These monomaniacs will make a \\nmountain out of a mole-hill … and see their fancies as sol-\\nid realities…. As far as I remember, it was Zametov’s story \\nthat cleared up half the mystery, to my mind. Why, I know \\none case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the \\n\\uf6460\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthroat of a little boy of eight, because he couldn’t endure the \\njokes he made every day at table! And in this case his rags, \\nthe insolent police officer, the fever and this suspicion! All \\nthat working upon a man half frantic with hypochondria, \\nand with his morbid exceptional vanity! That may well have \\nbeen the starting-point of illness. Well, bother it all! … And, \\nby the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but hm \\n… he shouldn’t have told all that last night. He is an awful \\nchatterbox!’\\n‘But whom did he tell it to? You and me?’\\n‘And Porfiry.',\n",
              " '’\\n‘What does that matter?’\\n‘And, by the way, have you any influence on them, his \\nmother and sister? Tell them to be more careful with him \\nto-day….’\\n‘They’ll get on all right!’ Razumihin answered reluctant-\\nly.\\n‘Why is he so set against this Luzhin? A man with money \\nand she doesn’t seem to dislike him … and they haven’t a \\nfarthing, I suppose? eh?’\\n‘But what business is it of yours?’ Razumihin cried with \\nannoyance. ‘How can I tell whether they’ve a farthing? Ask \\nthem yourself and perhaps you’ll find out….’\\n‘Foo! what an ass you are sometimes! Last night’s wine \\nhas not gone off yet…. Good-bye; thank your Praskovya \\nPavlovna from me for my night’s lodging. She locked herself \\nin, made no reply to my bonjour through the door; she was \\nup at seven o’clock, the samovar was taken into her from \\nthe kitchen. I was not vouchsafed a personal interview….’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6460\\uf647\\nAt nine o’clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodg-\\nings at Bakaleyev’s house. Both ladies were waiting for him \\nwith nervous impatience. They had risen at seven o’clock or \\nearlier. He entered looking as black as night, bowed awk-\\nwardly and was at once furious with himself for it. He had \\nreckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly \\nrushed at him, seized him by both hands and was almost \\nkissing them. He glanced timidly at Avdotya Romanovna, \\nbut her proud countenance wore at that moment an expres-\\nsion of such gratitude and friendliness, such complete and \\nunlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and ill-\\ndisguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into \\ngreater confusion than if he had been met with abuse. For-\\ntunately there was a subject for conversation, and he made \\nhaste to snatch at it.\\nHearing that everything was going well and that Rodya \\nhad not yet waked, Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared that \\nshe was glad to hear it, because ‘she had something which it \\nwas very, very necessary to talk over beforehand.’ Then fol-\\nlowed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation to have \\nit with them; they had waited to have it with him. Avdotya \\nRomanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty \\nwaiter, and they asked him to bring tea which was served at \\nlast, but in such a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies \\nwere ashamed. Razumihin vigorously attacked the lodgings, \\nbut, remembering Luzhin, stopped in embarrassment and \\nwas greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s questions, \\nwhich showered in a continual stream upon him.\\nHe talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly \\n\\uf6460\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ninterrupted by their questions, and succeeded in describ-\\ning to them all the most important facts he knew of the last \\nyear of Raskolnikov’s life, concluding with a circumstantial \\naccount of his illness. He omitted, however, many things, \\nwhich were better omitted, including the scene at the po-\\nlice station with all its consequences. They listened eagerly \\nto his story, and, when he thought he had finished and sat-\\nisfied his listeners, he found that they considered he had \\nhardly begun.\\n‘Tell me, tell me! What do you think … ? Excuse me, I \\nstill don’t know your name!’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna put \\nin hastily.\\n‘Dmitri Prokofitch.’\\n‘I should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch \\n… how he looks … on things in general now, that is, how can \\nI explain, what are his likes and dislikes? Is he always so ir-\\nritable? Tell me, if you can, what are his hopes and, so to say, \\nhis dreams? Under what influences is he now? In a word, I \\nshould like …’\\n‘Ah, mother, how can he answer all that at once?’ ob-\\nserved Dounia.\\n‘Good heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least \\nlike this, Dmitri Prokofitch!’\\n‘Naturally,’ answered Razumihin. ‘I have no mother, but \\nmy uncle comes every year and almost every time he can \\nscarcely recognise me, even in appearance, though he is a \\nclever man; and your three years’ separation means a great \\ndeal. What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion for a year \\nand a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6460\\uf649\\nof late—and perhaps for a long time before—he has been \\nsuspicious and fanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind \\nheart. He does not like showing his feelings and would rath-\\ner do a cruel thing than open his heart freely. Sometimes, \\nthough, he is not at all morbid, but simply cold and inhu-\\nmanly callous; it’s as though he were alternating between \\ntwo characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says \\nhe is so busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies \\nin bed doing nothing. He doesn’t jeer at things, not because \\nhe hasn’t the wit, but as though he hadn’t time to waste on \\nsuch trifles. He never listens to what is said to him. He is \\nnever interested in what interests other people at any given \\nmoment. He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps he is \\nright. Well, what more? I think your arrival will have a most \\nbeneficial influence upon him.’\\n‘God grant it may,’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, dis-\\ntressed by Razumihin’s account of her Rodya.\\nAnd Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Av-\\ndotya Romanovna at last.',\n",
              " 'He glanced at her often while he \\nwas talking, but only for a moment and looked away again \\nat once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening at-\\ntentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro \\nwith her arms folded and her lips compressed, occasion-\\nally putting in a question, without stopping her walk. She \\nhad the same habit of not listening to what was said. She \\nwas wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a white \\ntransparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon de-\\ntected signs of extreme poverty in their belongings. Had \\nAvdotya Romanovna been dressed like a queen, he felt that \\n\\uf6460\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nhe would not be afraid of her, but perhaps just because she \\nwas poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery of her \\nsurroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began \\nto be afraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, \\nwhich was very trying for a man who already felt diffident.\\n‘You’ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my \\nbrother’s character … and have told it impartially. I am glad. \\nI thought that you were too uncritically devoted to him,’ ob-\\nserved Avdotya Romanovna with a smile. ‘I think you are \\nright that he needs a woman’s care,’ she added thoughtful-\\nly.\\n‘I didn’t say so; but I daresay you are right, only …’\\n‘What?’\\n‘He loves no one and perhaps he never will,’ Razumihin \\ndeclared decisively.\\n‘You mean he is not capable of love?’\\n‘Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like \\nyour brother, in everything, indeed!’ he blurted out sud-\\ndenly to his own surprise, but remembering at once what \\nhe had just before said of her brother, he turned as red as a \\ncrab and was overcome with confusion. Avdotya Romanov-\\nna couldn’t help laughing when she looked at him.\\n‘You may both be mistaken about Rodya,’ Pulcheria Al-\\nexandrovna remarked, slightly piqued. ‘I am not talking \\nof our present difficulty, Dounia. What Pyotr Petrovitch \\nwrites in this letter and what you and I have supposed may \\nbe mistaken, but you can’t imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how \\nmoody and, so to say, capricious he is. I never could de-\\npend on what he would do when he was only fifteen. And I \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6460\\uf64b\\nam sure that he might do something now that nobody else \\nwould think of doing … Well, for instance, do you know how \\na year and a half ago he astounded me and gave me a shock \\nthat nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that \\ngirl—what was her name—his landlady’s daughter?’\\n‘Did you hear about that affair?’ asked Avdotya Ro-\\nmanovna.\\n‘Do you suppose——‘ Pulcheria Alexandrovna contin-\\nued warmly. ‘Do you suppose that my tears, my entreaties, \\nmy illness, my possible death from grief, our poverty would \\nhave made him pause? No, he would calmly have disregard-\\ned all obstacles. And yet it isn’t that he doesn’t love us!’\\n‘He has never spoken a word of that affair to me,’ Razu-\\nmihin answered cautiously. ‘But I did hear something from \\nPraskovya Pavlovna herself, though she is by no means a \\ngossip. And what I heard certainly was rather strange.’\\n‘And what did you hear?’ both the ladies asked at once.\\n‘Well, nothing very special. I only learned that the mar-\\nriage, which only failed to take place through the girl’s \\ndeath, was not at all to Praskovya Pavlovna’s liking. They \\nsay, too, the girl was not at all pretty, in fact I am told posi-\\ntively ugly … and such an invalid … and queer. But she \\nseems to have had some good qualities. She must have had \\nsome good qualities or it’s quite inexplicable…. She had no \\nmoney either and he wouldn’t have considered her money…. \\nBut it’s always difficult to judge in such matters.’\\n‘I am sure she was a good girl,’ Avdotya Romanovna ob-\\nserved briefly.\\n‘God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I \\n\\uf6460\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ndon’t know which of them would have caused most misery \\nto the other—he to her or she to him,’ Pulcheria Alexan-\\ndrovna concluded. Then she began tentatively questioning \\nhim about the scene on the previous day with Luzhin, hes-\\nitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to \\nthe latter’s annoyance. This incident more than all the rest \\nevidently caused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razu-\\nmihin described it in detail again, but this time he added \\nhis own conclusions: he openly blamed Raskolnikov for \\nintentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not seeking to ex-\\ncuse him on the score of his illness.\\n‘He had planned it before his illness,’ he added.',\n",
              " '‘I think so, too,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a \\ndejected air. But she was very much surprised at hearing \\nRazumihin express himself so carefully and even with a \\ncertain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch. Avdotya Romanov-\\nna, too, was struck by it.\\n‘So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?’ Pulcheria \\nAlexandrovna could not resist asking.\\n‘I can have no other opinion of your daughter’s future \\nhusband,’ Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, \\n‘and I don’t say it simply from vulgar politeness, but because \\n… simply because Avdotya Romanovna has of her own free \\nwill deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so rudely of him \\nlast night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and … \\nmad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely … \\nand this morning I am ashamed of it.’\\nHe crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanov-\\nna flushed, but did not break the silence. She had not uttered \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64610\\na word from the moment they began to speak of Luzhin.\\nWithout her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously \\ndid not know what to do. At last, faltering and continually \\nglancing at her daughter, she confessed that she was exceed-\\ningly worried by one circumstance.\\n‘You see, Dmitri Prokofitch,’ she began. ‘I’ll be perfectly \\nopen with Dmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?’\\n‘Of course, mother,’ said Avdotya Romanovna emphati-\\ncally.\\n‘This is what it is,’ she began in haste, as though the \\npermission to speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her \\nmind. ‘Very early this morning we got a note from Pyotr \\nPetrovitch in reply to our letter announcing our arrival. He \\npromised to meet us at the station, you know; instead of \\nthat he sent a servant to bring us the address of these lodg-\\nings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he \\nwould be here himself this morning. But this morning this \\nnote came from him. You’d better read it yourself; there \\nis one point in it which worries me very much … you will \\nsoon see what that is, and … tell me your candid opinion, \\nDmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodya’s character better than \\nanyone and no one can advise us better than you can. Dou-\\nnia, I must tell you, made her decision at once, but I still \\ndon’t feel sure how to act and I … I’ve been waiting for your \\nopinion.’\\nRazumihin opened the note which was dated the previ-\\nous evening and read as follows:\\n‘Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the hon-\\nour to inform you that owing to unforeseen obstacles I was \\n\\uf64611\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nrendered unable to meet you at the railway station; I sent a \\nvery competent person with the same object in view. I like-\\nwise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with \\nyou to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does \\nnot admit of delay, and also that I may not intrude on your \\nfamily circle while you are meeting your son, and Avdotya \\nRomanovna her brother. I shall have the honour of visit-\\ning you and paying you my respects at your lodgings not \\nlater than to-morrow evening at eight o’clock precisely, and \\nherewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, \\nimperative request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be \\npresent at our interview—as he offered me a gross and un-\\nprecedented affront on the occasion of my visit to him in \\nhis illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire from you \\npersonally an indispensable and circumstantial explana-\\ntion upon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn \\nyour own interpretation. I have the honour to inform you, \\nin anticipation, that if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion \\nRomanovitch, I shall be compelled to withdraw immedi-\\nately and then you have only yourself to blame. I write on \\nthe assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so \\nill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, \\nbeing able to leave the house, may visit you also. I was con-\\nfirmed in that belief by the testimony of my own eyes in \\nthe lodging of a drunken man who was run over and has \\nsince died, to whose daughter, a young woman of notori-\\nous behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext \\nof the funeral, which gravely surprised me knowing what \\npains you were at to raise that sum. Herewith expressing \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6461\\uf645\\nmy special respect to your estimable daughter, Avdotya Ro-\\nmanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage of\\n‘Your humble servant,\\n‘P. LUZHIN.’\\n‘What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?’ began Pulche-\\nria Alexandrovna, almost weeping. ‘How can I ask Rodya \\nnot to come? Yesterday he insisted so earnestly on our re-\\nfusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not to \\nreceive Rodya! He will come on purpose if he knows, and … \\nwhat will happen then?’\\n‘Act on Avdotya Romanovna’s decision,’ Razumihin an-\\nswered calmly at once.\\n‘Oh, dear me! She says … goodness knows what she says, \\nshe doesn’t explain her object! She says that it would be best, \\nat least, not that it would be best, but that it’s absolutely \\nnecessary that Rodya should make a point of being here at \\neight o’clock and that they must meet…. I didn’t want even \\nto show him the letter, but to prevent him from coming by \\nsome stratagem with your help … because he is so irrita-\\nble…. Besides I don’t understand about that drunkard who \\ndied and that daughter, and how he could have given the \\ndaughter all the money … which …’\\n‘Which cost you such sacrifice, mother,’ put in Avdotya \\nRomanovna.\\n‘He was not himself yesterday,’ Razumihin said thought-\\nfully, ‘if you only knew what he was up to in a restaurant \\nyesterday, though there was sense in it too…. Hm! He did \\nsay something, as we were going home yesterday evening, \\nabout a dead man and a girl, but I didn’t understand a \\n\\uf6461\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nword…. But last night, I myself …’\\n‘The best thing, mother, will be for us to go to him our-\\nselves and there I assure you we shall see at once what’s to \\nbe done. Besides, it’s getting late—good heavens, it’s past \\nten,’ she cried looking at a splendid gold enamelled watch \\nwhich hung round her neck on a thin Venetian chain, and \\nlooked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her dress. ‘A \\npresent from her fiancé ’ thought Razumihin.\\n‘We must start, Dounia, we must start,’ her mother cried \\nin a flutter.',\n",
              " '‘He will be thinking we are still angry after yes-\\nterday, from our coming so late. Merciful heavens!’\\nWhile she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat \\nand mantle; Dounia, too, put on her things. Her gloves, as \\nRazumihin noticed, were not merely shabby but had holes \\nin them, and yet this evident poverty gave the two ladies an \\nair of special dignity, which is always found in people who \\nknow how to wear poor clothes. Razumihin looked rever-\\nently at Dounia and felt proud of escorting her. ‘The queen \\nwho mended her stockings in prison,’ he thought, ‘must \\nhave looked then every inch a queen and even more a queen \\nthan at sumptuous banquets and levées.’\\n‘My God!’ exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna, ‘little did \\nI think that I should ever fear seeing my son, my darling, \\ndarling Rodya! I am afraid, Dmitri Prokofitch,’ she added, \\nglancing at him timidly.\\n‘Don’t be afraid, mother,’ said Dounia, kissing her, ‘better \\nhave faith in him.’\\n‘Oh, dear, I have faith in him, but I haven’t slept all night,’ \\nexclaimed the poor woman.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6461\\uf647\\nThey came out into the street.\\n‘Do you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this morn-\\ning I dreamed of Marfa Petrovna … she was all in white … \\nshe came up to me, took my hand, and shook her head at \\nme, but so sternly as though she were blaming me…. Is that \\na good omen? Oh, dear me! You don’t know, Dmitri Pro-\\nkofitch, that Marfa Petrovna’s dead!’\\n‘No, I didn’t know; who is Marfa Petrovna?’\\n‘She died suddenly; and only fancy …’\\n‘Afterwards, mamma,’ put in Dounia. ‘He doesn’t know \\nwho Marfa Petrovna is.’\\n‘Ah, you don’t know? And I was thinking that you knew \\nall about us. Forgive me, Dmitri Prokofitch, I don’t know \\nwhat I am thinking about these last few days. I look upon \\nyou really as a providence for us, and so I took it for granted \\nthat you knew all about us. I look on you as a relation…. \\nDon’t be angry with me for saying so. Dear me, what’s the \\nmatter with your right hand? Have you knocked it?’\\n‘Yes, I bruised it,’ muttered Razumihin overjoyed.\\n‘I sometimes speak too much from the heart, so that Dou-\\nnia finds fault with me…. But, dear me, what a cupboard he \\nlives in! I wonder whether he is awake? Does this woman, \\nhis landlady, consider it a room? Listen, you say he does not \\nlike to show his feelings, so perhaps I shall annoy him with \\nmy … weaknesses? Do advise me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how \\nam I to treat him? I feel quite distracted, you know.’\\n‘Don’t question him too much about anything if you see \\nhim frown; don’t ask him too much about his health; he \\ndoesn’t like that.’\\n\\uf6461\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘Ah, Dmitri Prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother! But \\nhere are the stairs…. What an awful staircase!’\\n‘Mother, you are quite pale, don’t distress yourself, dar-\\nling,’ said Dounia caressing her, then with flashing eyes she \\nadded: ‘He ought to be happy at seeing you, and you are tor-\\nmenting yourself so.’\\n‘Wait, I’ll peep in and see whether he has waked up.’\\nThe ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on \\nbefore, and when they reached the landlady’s door on the \\nfourth storey, they noticed that her door was a tiny crack \\nopen and that two keen black eyes were watching them \\nfrom the darkness within. When their eyes met, the door \\nwas suddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexan-\\ndrovna almost cried out.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6461\\uf649\\nChapter III\\n‘H\\ne is well, quite well!’ Zossimov cried cheerfully as \\nthey entered.\\nHe had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the \\nsame place as before, on the sofa. Raskolnikov was sitting in \\nthe opposite corner, fully dressed and carefully washed and \\ncombed, as he had not been for some time past. The room \\nwas immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managed to follow \\nthe visitors in and stayed to listen.\\nRaskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with \\nhis condition the day before, but he was still pale, listless, \\nand sombre. He looked like a wounded man or one who has \\nundergone some terrible physical suffering. His brows were \\nknitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish. He spoke lit-\\ntle and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there \\nwas a restlessness in his movements.\\nHe only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his \\nfinger to complete the impression of a man with a painful \\nabscess or a broken arm. The pale, sombre face lighted up \\nfor a moment when his mother and sister entered, but this \\nonly gave it a look of more intense suffering, in place of its \\nlistless dejection. The light soon died away, but the look of \\nsuffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying \\nhis patient with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to \\npractise, noticed in him no joy at the arrival of his mother \\n\\uf6461\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nand sister, but a sort of bitter, hidden determination to bear \\nanother hour or two of inevitable torture. He saw later that \\nalmost every word of the following conversation seemed to \\ntouch on some sore place and irritate it.',\n",
              " 'But at the same time \\nhe marvelled at the power of controlling himself and hid-\\ning his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a \\nmonomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.\\n‘Yes, I see myself now that I am almost well,’ said Raskol-\\nnikov, giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which \\nmade Pulcheria Alexandrovna radiant at once. ‘And I don’t \\nsay this as I did yesterday ’ he said, addressing Razumihin, \\nwith a friendly pressure of his hand.\\n‘Yes, indeed, I am quite surprised at him to-day,’ began \\nZossimov, much delighted at the ladies’ entrance, for he had \\nnot succeeded in keeping up a conversation with his patient \\nfor ten minutes. ‘In another three or four days, if he goes on \\nlike this, he will be just as before, that is, as he was a month \\nago, or two … or perhaps even three. This has been com-\\ning on for a long while…. eh? Confess, now, that it has been \\nperhaps your own fault?’ he added, with a tentative smile, as \\nthough still afraid of irritating him.\\n‘It is very possible,’ answered Raskolnikov coldly.\\n‘I should say, too,’ continued Zossimov with zest, ‘that \\nyour complete recovery depends solely on yourself. Now \\nthat one can talk to you, I should like to impress upon \\nyou that it is essential to avoid the elementary, so to speak, \\nfundamental causes tending to produce your morbid con-\\ndition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go from \\nbad to worse. These fundamental causes I don’t know, but \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6461\\uf64b\\nthey must be known to you. You are an intelligent man, and \\nmust have observed yourself, of course. I fancy the first \\nstage of your derangement coincides with your leaving the \\nuniversity. You must not be left without occupation, and so, \\nwork and a definite aim set before you might, I fancy, be \\nvery beneficial.’\\n‘Yes, yes; you are perfectly right…. I will make haste \\nand return to the university: and then everything will go \\nsmoothly….’\\nZossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to \\nmake an effect before the ladies, was certainly somewhat \\nmystified, when, glancing at his patient, he observed unmis-\\ntakable mockery on his face. This lasted an instant, however. \\nPulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking Zossimov, \\nespecially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.\\n‘What! he saw you last night?’ Raskolnikov asked, as \\nthough startled. ‘Then you have not slept either after your \\njourney.’\\n‘Ach, Rodya, that was only till two o’clock. Dounia and I \\nnever go to bed before two at home.’\\n‘I don’t know how to thank him either,’ Raskolnikov went \\non, suddenly frowning and looking down. ‘Setting aside \\nthe question of payment— forgive me for referring to it (he \\nturned to Zossimov)—I really don’t know what I have done \\nto deserve such special attention from you! I simply don’t \\nunderstand it … and … and … it weighs upon me, indeed, \\nbecause I don’t understand it. I tell you so candidly.’\\n‘Don’t be irritated.’ Zossimov forced himself to laugh. \\n‘Assume that you are my first patient—well—we fellows just \\n\\uf6461\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nbeginning to practise love our first patients as if they were \\nour children, and some almost fall in love with them. And, \\nof course, I am not rich in patients.’\\n‘I say nothing about him,’ added Raskolnikov, pointing \\nto Razumihin, ‘though he has had nothing from me either \\nbut insult and trouble.’\\n‘What nonsense he is talking! Why, you are in a senti-\\nmental mood to-day, are you?’ shouted Razumihin.\\nIf he had had more penetration he would have seen that \\nthere was no trace of sentimentality in him, but something \\nindeed quite the opposite. But Avdotya Romanovna noticed \\nit. She was intently and uneasily watching her brother.\\n‘As for you, mother, I don’t dare to speak,’ he went on, as \\nthough repeating a lesson learned by heart. ‘It is only to-\\nday that I have been able to realise a little how distressed \\nyou must have been here yesterday, waiting for me to come \\nback.’\\nWhen he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to \\nhis sister, smiling without a word. But in this smile there \\nwas a flash of real unfeigned feeling.',\n",
              " 'Dounia caught it at \\nonce, and warmly pressed his hand, overjoyed and thank-\\nful. It was the first time he had addressed her since their \\ndispute the previous day. The mother’s face lighted up with \\necstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken \\nreconciliation. ‘Yes, that is what I love him for,’ Razumihin, \\nexaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous \\nturn in his chair. ‘He has these movements.’\\n‘And how well he does it all,’ the mother was thinking to \\nherself. ‘What generous impulses he has, and how simply, \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf6450\\nhow delicately he put an end to all the misunderstanding \\nwith his sister—simply by holding out his hand at the right \\nminute and looking at her like that….

Good morning, Nastasya! … She \\ntold us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had \\njust run away from the doctor in delirium, and they were \\nlooking for you in the streets. You can’t imagine how we \\nfelt! I couldn’t help thinking of the tragic end of Lieutenant \\nPotanchikov, a friend of your father’s— you can’t remember \\nhim, Rodya—who ran out in the same way in a high fever \\nand fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn’t \\npull him out till next day. Of course, we exaggerated things. \\nWe were on the point of rushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to \\nask him to help….

Of course it’s very annoying….’ Raskolnikov \\nmuttered in reply, but with such a preoccupied and inatten-\\ntive air that Dounia gazed at him in perplexity.\\n‘What else was it I wanted to say?’ He went on trying \\nto recollect. ‘Oh, yes; mother, and you too, Dounia, please \\ndon’t think that I didn’t mean to come and see you to-day \\nand was waiting for you to come first.’\\n‘What are you saying, Rodya?’ cried Pulcheria Alexan-\\ndrovna. She, too, was surprised.\\n‘Is he answering us as a duty?’ Dounia wondered. ‘Is he \\nbeing reconciled and asking forgiveness as though he were \\nperforming a rite or repeating a lesson?’\\n‘I’ve only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was \\ndelayed owing to my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her … \\nNastasya … to wash out the blood … I’ve only just dressed.’\\n‘Blood! What blood?’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in \\nalarm.\\n‘Oh, nothing—don’t be uneasy. It was when I was wan-\\ndering about yesterday, rather delirious, I chanced upon a \\nman who had been run over … a clerk …’\\n‘Delirious? But you remember everything!’ Razumihin \\ninterrupted.\\n‘That’s true,’ Raskolnikov answered with special careful-\\nness. ‘I remember everything even to the slightest detail, \\nand yet—why I did that and went there and said that, I can’t \\nclearly explain now.’\\n‘A familiar phenomenon,’ interposed Zossimov, ‘actions \\nare sometimes performed in a masterly and most cunning \\nway, while the direction of the actions is deranged and de-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf645\\uf645\\npendent on various morbid impressions— it’s like a dream.’\\n‘Perhaps it’s a good thing really that he should think me \\nalmost a madman,’ thought Raskolnikov.\\n‘Why, people in perfect health act in the same way too,’ \\nobserved Dounia, looking uneasily at Zossimov.\\n‘There is some truth in your observation,’ the latter re-\\nplied. ‘In that sense we are certainly all not infrequently like \\nmadmen, but with the slight difference that the deranged \\nare somewhat madder, for we must draw a line. A normal \\nman, it is true, hardly exists. Among dozens—perhaps hun-\\ndreds of thousands—hardly one is to be met with.’\\nAt the word ‘madman,’ carelessly dropped by Zossimov \\nin his chatter on his favourite subject, everyone frowned.\\nRaskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged \\nin thought with a strange smile on his pale lips. He was still \\nmeditating on something.',\n",
              " '‘Well, what about the man who was run over? I interrupt-\\ned you!’ Razumihin cried hastily.\\n‘What?’ Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. ‘Oh … I got \\nspattered with blood helping to carry him to his lodging. \\nBy the way, mamma, I did an unpardonable thing yesterday. \\nI was literally out of my mind. I gave away all the money you \\nsent me … to his wife for the funeral. She’s a widow now, \\nin consumption, a poor creature … three little children, \\nstarving … nothing in the house … there’s a daughter, too \\n… perhaps you’d have given it yourself if you’d seen them. \\nBut I had no right to do it I admit, especially as I knew how \\nyou needed the money yourself.

Well, that’s praiseworthy, and it’s \\nbetter for you … and if you reach a line you won’t overstep, \\nyou will be unhappy … and if you overstep it, maybe you \\nwill be still unhappier…. But all that’s nonsense,’ he added \\nirritably, vexed at being carried away. ‘I only meant to say \\nthat I beg your forgiveness, mother,’ he concluded, shortly \\nand abruptly.\\n‘That’s enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you do \\nis very good,’ said his mother, delighted.\\n‘Don’t be too sure,’ he answered, twisting his mouth into \\na smile.\\nA silence followed. There was a certain constraint in all \\nthis conversation, and in the silence, and in the reconcilia-\\ntion, and in the forgiveness, and all were feeling it.\\n‘It is as though they were afraid of me,’ Raskolnikov was \\nthinking to himself, looking askance at his mother and \\nsister. Pulcheria Alexandrovna was indeed growing more \\ntimid the longer she kept silent.\\n‘Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much,’ \\nflashed through his mind.\\n‘Do you know, Rodya, Marfa Petrovna is dead,’ Pulcheria \\nAlexandrovna suddenly blurted out.\\n‘What Marfa Petrovna?’\\n‘Oh, mercy on us—Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlov. I wrote \\nyou so much about her.’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf645\\uf647\\n‘A-a-h! Yes, I remember…. So she’s dead! Oh, really?’ he \\nroused himself suddenly, as if waking up. ‘What did she die \\nof?’\\n‘Only imagine, quite suddenly,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna \\nanswered hurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity. ‘On the \\nvery day I was sending you that letter! Would you believe it, \\nthat awful man seems to have been the cause of her death. \\nThey say he beat her dreadfully.’\\n‘Why, were they on such bad terms?’ he asked, address-\\ning his sister.\\n‘Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her, he was \\nalways very patient, considerate even. In fact, all those sev-\\nen years of their married life he gave way to her, too much \\nso indeed, in many cases. All of a sudden he seems to have \\nlost patience.’\\n‘Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled \\nhimself for seven years? You seem to be defending him, \\nDounia?’\\n‘No, no, he’s an awful man! I can imagine nothing more \\nawful!’ Dounia answered, almost with a shudder, knitting \\nher brows, and sinking into thought.\\n‘That had happened in the morning,’ Pulcheria Alex-\\nandrovna went on hurriedly. ‘And directly afterwards she \\nordered the horses to be harnessed to drive to the town im-\\nmediately after dinner.',\n",
              " 'She always used to drive to the town \\nin such cases. She ate a very good dinner, I am told….’\\n‘After the beating?’\\n‘That was always her … habit; and immediately after \\ndinner, so as not to be late in starting, she went to the bath-\\n\\uf646\\uf645\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nhouse…. You see, she was undergoing some treatment with \\nbaths. They have a cold spring there, and she used to bathe \\nin it regularly every day, and no sooner had she got into the \\nwater when she suddenly had a stroke!’\\n‘I should think so,’ said Zossimov.\\n‘And did he beat her badly?’\\n‘What does that matter!’ put in Dounia.\\n‘H’m! But I don’t know why you want to tell us such gos-\\nsip, mother,’ said Raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite \\nof himself.\\n‘Ah, my dear, I don’t know what to talk about,’ broke \\nfrom Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n‘Why, are you all afraid of me?’ he asked, with a con-\\nstrained smile.\\n‘That’s certainly true,’ said Dounia, looking directly and \\nsternly at her brother. ‘Mother was crossing herself with \\nterror as she came up the stairs.’\\nHis face worked, as though in convulsion.\\n‘Ach, what are you saying, Dounia! Don’t be angry, please, \\nRodya…. Why did you say that, Dounia?’ Pulcheria Alex-\\nandrovna began, overwhelmed—‘You see, coming here, I \\nwas dreaming all the way, in the train, how we should meet, \\nhow we should talk over everything together…. And I was \\nso happy, I did not notice the journey! But what am I say-\\ning? I am happy now…. You should not, Dounia…. I am \\nhappy now—simply in seeing you, Rodya….’\\n‘Hush, mother,’ he muttered in confusion, not looking \\nat her, but pressing her hand. ‘We shall have time to speak \\nfreely of everything!’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf645\\uf649\\nAs he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with con-\\nfusion and turned pale. Again that awful sensation he had \\nknown of late passed with deadly chill over his soul. Again \\nit became suddenly plain and perceptible to him that he had \\njust told a fearful lie—that he would never now be able to \\nspeak freely of everything—that he would never again be \\nable to speak of anything to anyone. The anguish of this \\nthought was such that for a moment he almost forgot him-\\nself. He got up from his seat, and not looking at anyone \\nwalked towards the door.\\n‘What are you about?’ cried Razumihin, clutching him \\nby the arm.\\nHe sat down again, and began looking about him, in si-\\nlence. They were all looking at him in perplexity.\\n‘But what are you all so dull for?’ he shouted, suddenly \\nand quite unexpectedly. ‘Do say something! What’s the use \\nof sitting like this? Come, do speak. Let us talk…. We meet \\ntogether and sit in silence….

I remembered something,’ he answered, \\nand suddenly laughed.\\n‘Well, if you remembered something; that’s all right! … I \\nwas beginning to think …’ muttered Zossimov, getting up \\nfrom the sofa. ‘It is time for me to be off.

I believe I have \\nmet him somewhere—— … And this is a good man, too,’ he \\nnodded at Razumihin. ‘Do you like him, Dounia?’ he asked \\nher; and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed.\\n‘Very much,’ answered Dounia.\\n‘Foo!—what a pig you are!’ Razumihin protested, blush-\\ning in terrible confusion, and he got up from his chair. \\nPulcheria Alexandrovna smiled faintly, but Raskolnikov \\nlaughed aloud.\\n‘Where are you off to?’\\n‘I must go.’\\n‘You need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone, so you \\nmust. Don’t go. What’s the time? Is it twelve o’clock? What \\na pretty watch you have got, Dounia. But why are you all si-\\nlent again?

Hardly like a lady’s.’\\n‘I like that sort,’ said Dounia.\\n‘So it is not a present from her fiancé ’ thought Razumi-\\nhin, and was unreasonably delighted.\\n‘I thought it was Luzhin’s present,’ observed Raskol-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf645\\uf64b\\nnikov.\\n‘No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet.’\\n‘A-ah!

What shall I tell you? I don’t remember much \\nindeed. She was such a sickly girl,’ he went on, growing \\ndreamy and looking down again. ‘Quite an invalid. She was \\nfond of giving alms to the poor, and was always dreaming \\nof a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she began \\ntalking to me about it. Yes, yes, I remember. I remember \\nvery well. She was an ugly little thing. I really don’t know \\nwhat drew me to her then—I think it was because she was \\nalways ill. If she had been lame or hunchback, I believe I \\nshould have liked her better still,’ he smiled dreamily. ‘Yes, \\nit was a sort of spring delirium.’\\n‘No, it was not only spring delirium,’ said Dounia, with \\nwarm feeling.\\nHe fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not \\nhear or did not understand her words. Then, completely \\nlost in thought, he got up, went up to his mother, kissed her, \\nwent back to his place and sat down.\\n‘You love her even now?’ said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, \\ntouched.\\n‘Her?

I think you said to-day?’\\n‘Mother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch’s letter,’ said Dou-\\nnia.\\nWith trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave \\nhim the letter. He took it with great interest, but, before \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf646\\uf645\\nopening it, he suddenly looked with a sort of wonder at \\nDounia.\\n‘It is strange,’ he said, slowly, as though struck by a new \\nidea. ‘What am I making such a fuss for? What is it all \\nabout? Marry whom you like!’\\nHe said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and \\nlooked for some time at his sister, as though puzzled. He \\nopened the letter at last, still with the same look of strange \\nwonder on his face. Then, slowly and attentively, he began \\nreading, and read it through twice. Pulcheria Alexandrovna \\nshowed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected something \\nparticular.\\n‘What surprises me,’ he began, after a short pause, hand-\\ning the letter to his mother, but not addressing anyone in \\nparticular, ‘is that he is a business man, a lawyer, and his \\nconversation is pretentious indeed, and yet he writes such \\nan uneducated letter.’\\nThey all started. They had expected something quite dif-\\nferent.\\n‘But they all write like that, you know,’ Razumihin ob-\\nserved, abruptly.\\n‘Have you read it?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘We showed him, Rodya. We … consulted him just now,’ \\nPulcheria Alexandrovna began, embarrassed.\\n‘That’s just the jargon of the courts,’ Razumihin put in. \\n‘Legal documents are written like that to this day.’\\n‘Legal? Yes, it’s just legal—business language—not so very \\nuneducated, and not quite educated—business language!’\\n\\uf646\\uf646\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had \\na cheap education, he is proud indeed of having made his \\nown way,’ Avdotya Romanovna observed, somewhat of-\\nfended by her brother’s tone.\\n‘Well, if he’s proud of it, he has reason, I don’t deny it. You \\nseem to be offended, sister, at my making only such a frivo-\\nlous criticism on the letter, and to think that I speak of such \\ntrifling matters on purpose to annoy you. It is quite the con-\\ntrary, an observation apropos of the style occurred to me \\nthat is by no means irrelevant as things stand. There is one \\nexpression, ‘blame yourselves’ put in very significantly and \\nplainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at \\nonce if I am present.',\n",
              " 'That threat to go away is equivalent to \\na threat to abandon you both if you are disobedient, and to \\nabandon you now after summoning you to Petersburg. Well, \\nwhat do you think? Can one resent such an expression from \\nLuzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had \\nwritten it, or Zossimov, or one of us?’\\n‘N-no,’ answered Dounia, with more animation. ‘I saw \\nclearly that it was too naïvely expressed, and that perhaps \\nhe simply has no skill in writing … that is a true criticism, \\nbrother. I did not expect, indeed …’\\n‘It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than per-\\nhaps he intended. But I must disillusion you a little. There \\nis one expression in the letter, one slander about me, and \\nrather a contemptible one. I gave the money last night to \\nthe widow, a woman in consumption, crushed with trouble, \\nand not ‘on the pretext of the funeral,’ but simply to pay for \\nthe funeral, and not to the daughter—a young woman, as \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf646\\uf647\\nhe writes, of notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for \\nthe first time in my life)—but to the widow. In all this I see \\na too hasty desire to slander me and to raise dissension be-\\ntween us. It is expressed again in legal jargon, that is to say, \\nwith a too obvious display of the aim, and with a very naïve \\neagerness. He is a man of intelligence, but to act sensibly, in-\\ntelligence is not enough. It all shows the man and … I don’t \\nthink he has a great esteem for you. I tell you this simply to \\nwarn you, because I sincerely wish for your good …’\\nDounia did not reply. Her resolution had been taken. She \\nwas only awaiting the evening.\\n‘Then what is your decision, Rodya?’ asked Pulcheria Al-\\nexandrovna, who was more uneasy than ever at the sudden, \\nnew businesslike tone of his talk.\\n‘What decision?’\\n‘You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be \\nwith us this evening, and that he will go away if you come. \\nSo will you … come?’\\n‘That, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, \\nif you are not offended by such a request; and secondly, by \\nDounia, if she, too, is not offended. I will do what you think \\nbest,’ he added, drily.\\n‘Dounia has already decided, and I fully agree with her,’ \\nPulcheria Alexandrovna hastened to declare.\\n‘I decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be \\nwith us at this interview,’ said Dounia. ‘Will you come?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘I will ask you, too, to be with us at eight o’clock,’ she said, \\naddressing Razumihin. ‘Mother, I am inviting him, too.’\\n\\uf646\\uf646\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘Quite right, Dounia. Well, since you have decided,’ \\nadded Pulcheria Alexandrovna, ‘so be it. I shall feel easier \\nmyself. I do not like concealment and deception. Better let \\nus have the whole truth…. Pyotr Petrovitch may be angry \\nor not, now!’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf646\\uf649\\nChapter IV\\nA\\nt that moment the door was softly opened, and a young \\ngirl walked into the room, looking timidly about her. \\nEveryone turned towards her with surprise and curiosity. \\nAt first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise her. It was So-\\nfya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her yesterday \\nfor the first time, but at such a moment, in such surround-\\nings and in such a dress, that his memory retained a very \\ndifferent image of her. Now she was a modestly and poorly-\\ndressed young girl, very young, indeed, almost like a child, \\nwith a modest and refined manner, with a candid but some-\\nwhat frightened-looking face. She was wearing a very plain \\nindoor dress, and had on a shabby old- fashioned hat, but \\nshe still carried a parasol. Unexpectedly finding the room \\nfull of people, she was not so much embarrassed as com-\\npletely overwhelmed with shyness, like a little child. She \\nwas even about to retreat. ‘Oh … it’s you!’ said Raskolnikov, \\nextremely astonished, and he, too, was confused. He at once \\nrecollected that his mother and sister knew through Lu-\\nzhin’s letter of ‘some young woman of notorious behaviour.',\n",
              " '’ \\nHe had only just been protesting against Luzhin’s calumny \\nand declaring that he had seen the girl last night for the \\nfirst time, and suddenly she had walked in. He remembered, \\ntoo, that he had not protested against the expression ‘of no-\\ntorious behaviour.’ All this passed vaguely and fleetingly \\n\\uf646\\uf646\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthrough his brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw \\nthat the humiliated creature was so humiliated that he felt \\nsuddenly sorry for her. When she made a movement to re-\\ntreat in terror, it sent a pang to his heart.\\n‘I did not expect you,’ he said, hurriedly, with a look that \\nmade her stop. ‘Please sit down. You come, no doubt, from \\nKaterina Ivanovna. Allow me—not there. Sit here….’\\nAt Sonia’s entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on \\none of Raskolnikov’s three chairs, close to the door, got up \\nto allow her to enter. Raskolnikov had at first shown her the \\nplace on the sofa where Zossimov had been sitting, but feel-\\ning that the sofa which served him as a bed, was too familiar \\na place, he hurriedly motioned her to Razumihin’s chair.\\n‘You sit here,’ he said to Razumihin, putting him on the \\nsofa.\\nSonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked \\ntimidly at the two ladies. It was evidently almost inconceiv-\\nable to herself that she could sit down beside them. At the \\nthought of it, she was so frightened that she hurriedly got \\nup again, and in utter confusion addressed Raskolnikov.\\n‘I … I … have come for one minute. Forgive me for dis-\\nturbing you,’ she began falteringly. ‘I come from Katerina \\nIvanovna, and she had no one to send. Katerina Ivanovna \\ntold me to beg you … to be at the service … in the morning \\n… at Mitrofanievsky … and then … to us … to her … to do \\nher the honour … she told me to beg you …’ Sonia stam-\\nmered and ceased speaking.\\n‘I will try, certainly, most certainly,’ answered Raskol-\\nnikov. He, too, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf646\\uf64b\\nfinish his sentence. ‘Please sit down,’ he said, suddenly. ‘I \\nwant to talk to you. You are perhaps in a hurry, but please, \\nbe so kind, spare me two minutes,’ and he drew up a chair \\nfor her.\\nSonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hur-\\nried, frightened look at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes. \\nRaskolnikov’s pale face flushed, a shudder passed over him, \\nhis eyes glowed.\\n‘Mother,’ he said, firmly and insistently, ‘this is Sofya \\nSemyonovna Marmeladov, the daughter of that unfortu-\\nnate Mr. Marmeladov, who was run over yesterday before \\nmy eyes, and of whom I was just telling you.’\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly \\nscrewed up her eyes. In spite of her embarrassment before \\nRodya’s urgent and challenging look, she could not deny \\nherself that satisfaction. Dounia gazed gravely and intently \\ninto the poor girl’s face, and scrutinised her with perplex-\\nity. Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise her eyes \\nagain, but was more embarrassed than ever.\\n‘I wanted to ask you,’ said Raskolnikov, hastily, ‘how \\nthings were arranged yesterday. You were not worried by \\nthe police, for instance?’\\n‘No, that was all right … it was too evident, the cause of \\ndeath … they did not worry us … only the lodgers are an-\\ngry.’\\n‘Why?’\\n‘At the body’s remaining so long. You see it is hot now. \\nSo that, to-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the \\nchapel, until to-morrow. At first Katerina Ivanovna was un-\\n\\uf646\\uf646\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nwilling, but now she sees herself that it’s necessary …’\\n‘To-day, then?’\\n‘She begs you to do us the honour to be in the church \\nto-morrow for the service, and then to be present at the fu-\\nneral lunch.',\n",
              " '’\\n‘She is giving a funeral lunch?’\\n‘Yes … just a little…. She told me to thank you very much \\nfor helping us yesterday. But for you, we should have had \\nnothing for the funeral.’\\nAll at once her lips and chin began trembling, but, with \\nan effort, she controlled herself, looking down again.\\nDuring the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her \\ncarefully. She had a thin, very thin, pale little face, rather \\nirregular and angular, with a sharp little nose and chin. She \\ncould not have been called pretty, but her blue eyes were \\nso clear, and when they lighted up, there was such a kind-\\nliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not \\nhelp being attracted. Her face, and her whole figure indeed, \\nhad another peculiar characteristic. In spite of her eighteen \\nyears, she looked almost a little girl—almost a child. And in \\nsome of her gestures, this childishness seemed almost ab-\\nsurd.\\n‘But has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with \\nsuch small means? Does she even mean to have a funeral \\nlunch?’ Raskolnikov asked, persistently keeping up the con-\\nversation.\\n‘The coffin will be plain, of course … and everything will \\nbe plain, so it won’t cost much. Katerina Ivanovna and I \\nhave reckoned it all out, so that there will be enough left \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf6470\\n… and Katerina Ivanovna was very anxious it should be so. \\nYou know one can’t … it’s a comfort to her … she is like that, \\nyou know….’\\n‘I understand, I understand … of course … why do you \\nlook at my room like that? My mother has just said it is like \\na tomb.’\\n‘You gave us everything yesterday,’ Sonia said suddenly, \\nin reply, in a loud rapid whisper; and again she looked down \\nin confusion. Her lips and chin were trembling once more. \\nShe had been struck at once by Raskolnikov’s poor sur-\\nroundings, and now these words broke out spontaneously. \\nA silence followed. There was a light in Dounia’s eyes, and \\neven Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.\\n‘Rodya,’ she said, getting up, ‘we shall have dinner togeth-\\ner, of course. Come, Dounia…. And you, Rodya, had better \\ngo for a little walk, and then rest and lie down before you \\ncome to see us…. I am afraid we have exhausted you….’\\n‘Yes, yes, I’ll come,’ he answered, getting up fussily. ‘But I \\nhave something to see to.’\\n‘But surely you will have dinner together?’ cried Razu-\\nmihin, looking in surprise at Raskolnikov. ‘What do you \\nmean?’\\n‘Yes, yes, I am coming … of course, of course! And you \\nstay a minute. You do not want him just now, do you, moth-\\ner? Or perhaps I am taking him from you?’\\n‘Oh, no, no. And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the \\nfavour of dining with us?’\\n‘Please do,’ added Dounia.\\nRazumihin bowed, positively radiant. For one moment, \\n\\uf646\\uf6471\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthey were all strangely embarrassed.\\n‘Good-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet. I do not like say-\\ning good-bye.

Sonia, in confusion, gave a hurried, frightened \\ncurtsy.',\n",
              " 'There was a look of poignant discomfort in her face, \\nas though Avdotya Romanovna’s courtesy and attention \\nwere oppressive and painful to her.\\n‘Dounia, good-bye,’ called Raskolnikov, in the passage. \\n‘Give me your hand.’\\n‘Why, I did give it to you.

All this was done in an instant as he passed, and try-\\ning not to betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as \\nthough waiting for something. He was waiting for Sonia; he \\nsaw that they were parting, and that Sonia was going home.\\n‘Home? Where? I’ve seen that face somewhere,’ he \\nthought. ‘I must find out.’\\nAt the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw \\nSonia coming the same way, noticing nothing. She turned \\nthe corner.

He had a broad, rather pleasant face \\nwith high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen \\nin Petersburg. His flaxen hair was still abundant, and only \\ntouched here and there with grey, and his thick square beard \\nwas even lighter than his hair.

The doors were two or three yards apart.\\n‘You lodge at Kapernaumov’s,’ he said, looking at Sonia \\nand laughing. ‘He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday. I am \\nstaying close here at Madame Resslich’s. How odd!’ Sonia \\nlooked at him attentively.\\n‘We are neighbours,’ he went on gaily. ‘I only came to \\ntown the day before yesterday.

I am so sick of it all!’ Ras-\\nkolnikov cried with exaggerated irritability. It was partly \\nassumed, however.\\n‘I know, I know, I understand. Believe me, I understand. \\nOne’s ashamed to speak of it.’\\n‘If you are ashamed, then don’t speak of it.’\\nBoth were silent. Razumihin was more than ecstatic and \\nRaskolnikov perceived it with repulsion. He was alarmed, \\ntoo, by what Razumihin had just said about Porfiry.\\n‘I shall have to pull a long face with him too,’ he thought, \\nwith a beating heart, and he turned white, ‘and do it natu-\\nrally, too. But the most natural thing would be to do nothing \\nat all. Carefully do nothing at all! No, carefully would not \\nbe natural again…. Oh, well, we shall see how it turns out…. \\nWe shall see … directly. Is it a good thing to go or not? The \\nbutterfly flies to the light. My heart is beating, that’s what’s \\nbad!’\\n‘In this grey house,’ said Razumihin.\\n‘The most important thing, does Porfiry know that I was \\n\\uf646\\uf6481\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nat the old hag’s flat yesterday … and asked about the blood? \\nI must find that out instantly, as soon as I go in, find out \\nfrom his face; otherwise … I’ll find out, if it’s my ruin.’\\n‘I say, brother,’ he said suddenly, addressing Razumihin, \\nwith a sly smile, ‘I have been noticing all day that you seem \\nto be curiously excited. Isn’t it so?’\\n‘Excited? Not a bit of it,’ said Razumihin, stung to the \\nquick.\\n‘Yes, brother, I assure you it’s noticeable. Why, you sat on \\nyour chair in a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, \\nand you seemed to be writhing all the time. You kept jump-\\ning up for nothing. One moment you were angry, and the \\nnext your face looked like a sweetmeat. You even blushed; \\nespecially when you were invited to dinner, you blushed \\nawfully.’\\n‘Nothing of the sort, nonsense! What do you mean?’\\n‘But why are you wriggling out of it, like a schoolboy? By \\nJove, there he’s blushing again.',\n",
              " '’\\n‘What a pig you are!’\\n‘But why are you so shamefaced about it? Romeo! Stay, \\nI’ll tell of you to-day. Ha-ha-ha! I’ll make mother laugh, and \\nsomeone else, too …’\\n‘Listen, listen, listen, this is serious…. What next, you \\nfiend!’ Razumihin was utterly overwhelmed, turning cold \\nwith horror. ‘What will you tell them? Come, brother … \\nfoo! what a pig you are!’\\n‘You are like a summer rose. And if only you knew how \\nit suits you; a Romeo over six foot high! And how you’ve \\nwashed to-day—you cleaned your nails, I declare. Eh? That’s \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf648\\uf645\\nsomething unheard of! Why, I do believe you’ve got poma-\\ntum on your hair! Bend down.’\\n‘Pig!’\\nRaskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain \\nhimself. So laughing, they entered Porfiry Petrovitch’s flat. \\nThis is what Raskolnikov wanted: from within they could \\nbe heard laughing as they came in, still guffawing in the \\npassage.\\n‘Not a word here or I’ll … brain you!’ Razumihin whis-\\npered furiously, seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder.\\n\\uf646\\uf648\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter V\\nR\\naskolnikov was already entering the room. He came in \\nlooking as though he had the utmost difficulty not to \\nburst out laughing again. Behind him Razumihin strode in \\ngawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony, with \\nan utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression. His face \\nand whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and \\namply justified Raskolnikov’s laughter. Raskolnikov, not \\nwaiting for an introduction, bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, \\nwho stood in the middle of the room looking inquiringly at \\nthem. He held out his hand and shook hands, still apparent-\\nly making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a \\nfew words to introduce himself. But he had no sooner suc-\\nceeded in assuming a serious air and muttering something \\nwhen he suddenly glanced again as though accidentally at \\nRazumihin, and could no longer control himself: his stifled \\nlaughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried to \\nrestrain it. The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumi-\\nhin received this ‘spontaneous’ mirth gave the whole scene \\nthe appearance of most genuine fun and naturalness. Razu-\\nmihin strengthened this impression as though on purpose.\\n‘Fool! You fiend,’ he roared, waving his arm which at \\nonce struck a little round table with an empty tea-glass on \\nit. Everything was sent flying and crashing.\\n‘But why break chairs, gentlemen? You know it’s a loss to \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf648\\uf647\\nthe Crown,’ Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily.\\nRaskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in Porfiry \\nPetrovitch’s, but anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right \\nmoment to put a natural end to it. Razumihin, completely \\nput to confusion by upsetting the table and smashing the \\nglass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed and turned \\nsharply to the window where he stood looking out with his \\nback to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, \\nseeing nothing. Porfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready \\nto go on laughing, but obviously looked for explanations. \\nZametov had been sitting in the corner, but he rose at the \\nvisitors’ entrance and was standing in expectation with a \\nsmile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and even \\nit seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov \\nwith a certain embarrassment. Zametov’s unexpected pres-\\nence struck Raskolnikov unpleasantly.\\n‘I’ve got to think of that,’ he thought. ‘Excuse me, please,’ \\nhe began, affecting extreme embarrassment. ‘Raskolnikov.’\\n‘Not at all, very pleasant to see you … and how pleasantly \\nyou’ve come in…. Why, won’t he even say good-morning?’ \\nPorfiry Petrovitch nodded at Razumihin.\\n‘Upon my honour I don’t know why he is in such a rage \\nwith me. I only told him as we came along that he was like \\nRomeo … and proved it. And that was all, I think!’\\n‘Pig!’ ejaculated Razumihin, without turning round.\\n‘There must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is \\nso furious at the word,’ Porfiry laughed.\\n‘Oh, you sharp lawyer! … Damn you all!’ snapped Razu-\\nmihin, and suddenly bursting out laughing himself, he went \\n\\uf646\\uf648\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nup to Porfiry with a more cheerful face as though nothing \\nhad happened. ‘That’ll do! We are all fools.',\n",
              " 'To come to busi-\\nness. This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov; \\nin the first place he has heard of you and wants to make \\nyour acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of \\nbusiness with you. Bah! Zametov, what brought you here? \\nHave you met before? Have you known each other long?’\\n‘What does this mean?’ thought Raskolnikov uneasily.\\nZametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.\\n‘Why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday,’ he said eas-\\nily.\\n‘Then I have been spared the trouble. All last week he was \\nbegging me to introduce him to you. Porfiry and you have \\nsniffed each other out without me. Where is your tobacco?’\\nPorfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very \\nclean linen, and trodden-down slippers. He was a man of \\nabout five and thirty, short, stout even to corpulence, and \\nclean shaven. He wore his hair cut short and had a large \\nround head, particularly prominent at the back. His soft, \\nround, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish co-\\nlour, but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression. It \\nwould have been good-natured except for a look in the eyes, \\nwhich shone with a watery, mawkish light under almost \\nwhite, blinking eyelashes. The expression of those eyes was \\nstrangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish fig-\\nure, and gave it something far more serious than could be \\nguessed at first sight.\\nAs soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had \\na little matter of business with him, he begged him to sit \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf648\\uf649\\ndown on the sofa and sat down himself on the other end, \\nwaiting for him to explain his business, with that careful \\nand over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and \\nembarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if \\nwhat you are discussing is in your opinion of far too little \\nimportance for such exceptional solemnity. But in brief and \\ncoherent phrases Raskolnikov explained his business clear-\\nly and exactly, and was so well satisfied with himself that \\nhe even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry. Porfiry \\nPetrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. Razumihin, \\nsitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and im-\\npatiently, looking from one to the other every moment with \\nrather excessive interest.\\n‘Fool,’ Raskolnikov swore to himself.\\n‘You have to give information to the police,’ Porfiry re-\\nplied, with a most businesslike air, ‘that having learnt of \\nthis incident, that is of the murder, you beg to inform the \\nlawyer in charge of the case that such and such things be-\\nlong to you, and that you desire to redeem them … or … but \\nthey will write to you.’\\n‘That’s just the point, that at the present moment,’ Ras-\\nkolnikov tried his utmost to feign embarrassment, ‘I am not \\nquite in funds … and even this trifling sum is beyond me \\n… I only wanted, you see, for the present to declare that the \\nthings are mine, and that when I have money….’\\n‘That’s no matter,’ answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving \\nhis explanation of his pecuniary position coldly, ‘but you \\ncan, if you prefer, write straight to me, to say, that having \\nbeen informed of the matter, and claiming such and such \\n\\uf646\\uf648\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nas your property, you beg …’\\n‘On an ordinary sheet of paper?’ Raskolnikov inter-\\nrupted eagerly, again interested in the financial side of the \\nquestion.\\n‘Oh, the most ordinary,’ and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch \\nlooked with obvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, \\nas it were, winking at him. But perhaps it was Raskolnikov’s \\nfancy, for it all lasted but a moment. There was certainly \\nsomething of the sort, Raskolnikov could have sworn he \\nwinked at him, goodness knows why.\\n‘He knows,’ flashed through his mind like lightning.\\n‘Forgive my troubling you about such trifles,’ he went \\non, a little disconcerted, ‘the things are only worth five \\nroubles, but I prize them particularly for the sake of those \\nfrom whom they came to me, and I must confess that I was \\nalarmed when I heard …’\\n‘That’s why you were so much struck when I mentioned \\nto Zossimov that Porfiry was inquiring for everyone who \\nhad pledges!’ Razumihin put in with obvious intention.\\nThis was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help \\nglancing at him with a flash of vindictive anger in his black \\neyes, but immediately recollected himself.\\n‘You seem to be jeering at me, brother?’ he said to him, \\nwith a well- feigned irritability. ‘I dare say I do seem to you \\nabsurdly anxious about such trash; but you mustn’t think \\nme selfish or grasping for that, and these two things may be \\nanything but trash in my eyes. I told you just now that the \\nsilver watch, though it’s not worth a cent, is the only thing \\nleft us of my father’s. You may laugh at me, but my mother \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf648\\uf64b\\nis here,’ he turned suddenly to Porfiry, ‘and if she knew,’ he \\nturned again hurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his \\nvoice tremble, ‘that the watch was lost, she would be in de-\\nspair! You know what women are!’\\n‘Not a bit of it! I didn’t mean that at all! Quite the con-\\ntrary!’ shouted Razumihin distressed.\\n‘Was it right? Was it natural? Did I overdo it?’ Raskol-\\nnikov asked himself in a tremor. ‘Why did I say that about \\nwomen?’\\n‘Oh, your mother is with you?’ Porfiry Petrovitch in-\\nquired.\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘When did she come?’\\n‘Last night.’\\nPorfiry paused as though reflecting.\\n‘Your things would not in any case be lost,’ he went on \\ncalmly and coldly.',\n",
              " '‘I have been expecting you here for some \\ntime.’\\nAnd as though that was a matter of no importance, he \\ncarefully offered the ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruth-\\nlessly scattering cigarette ash over the carpet. Raskolnikov \\nshuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to be looking at him, \\nand was still concerned with Razumihin’s cigarette.\\n‘What? Expecting him? Why, did you know that he had \\npledges there?’ cried Razumihin.\\nPorfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov.\\n‘Your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up \\ntogether, and on the paper your name was legibly written in \\npencil, together with the date on which you left them with \\n\\uf646\\uf648\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nher …’\\n‘How observant you are!’ Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, \\ndoing his very utmost to look him straight in the face, but \\nhe failed, and suddenly added:\\n‘I say that because I suppose there were a great many \\npledges … that it must be difficult to remember them all…. \\nBut you remember them all so clearly, and … and …’\\n‘Stupid! Feeble!’ he thought. ‘Why did I add that?’\\n‘But we know all who had pledges, and you are the only \\none who hasn’t come forward,’ Porfiry answered with hard-\\nly perceptible irony.\\n‘I haven’t been quite well.’\\n‘I heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great \\ndistress about something. You look pale still.’\\n‘I am not pale at all…. No, I am quite well,’ Raskolnikov \\nsnapped out rudely and angrily, completely changing his \\ntone. His anger was mounting, he could not repress it. ‘And \\nin my anger I shall betray myself,’ flashed through his mind \\nagain. ‘Why are they torturing me?’\\n‘Not quite well!’ Razumihin caught him up. ‘What next! \\nHe was unconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would \\nyou believe, Porfiry, as soon as our backs were turned, he \\ndressed, though he could hardly stand, and gave us the slip \\nand went off on a spree somewhere till midnight, delirious \\nall the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!’\\n‘Really delirious? You don’t say so!’ Porfiry shook his \\nhead in a womanish way.\\n‘Nonsense! Don’t you believe it! But you don’t believe it \\nanyway,’ Raskolnikov let slip in his anger. But Porfiry Petro-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf6490\\nvitch did not seem to catch those strange words.\\n‘But how could you have gone out if you hadn’t been de-\\nlirious?’ Razumihin got hot suddenly. ‘What did you go out \\nfor? What was the object of it? And why on the sly? Were \\nyou in your senses when you did it? Now that all danger is \\nover I can speak plainly.’\\n‘I was awfully sick of them yesterday.’ Raskolnikov ad-\\ndressed Porfiry suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, \\n‘I ran away from them to take lodgings where they wouldn’t \\nfind me, and took a lot of money with me. Mr. Zametov \\nthere saw it. I say, Mr. Zametov, was I sensible or delirious \\nyesterday; settle our dispute.’\\nHe could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so \\nhateful were his expression and his silence to him.\\n‘In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but \\nyou were extremely irritable,’ Zametov pronounced dryly.\\n‘And Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day,’ put in \\nPorfiry Petrovitch, ‘that he met you very late last night in \\nthe lodging of a man who had been run over.’\\n‘And there,’ said Razumihin, ‘weren’t you mad then? You \\ngave your last penny to the widow for the funeral. If you \\nwanted to help, give fifteen or twenty even, but keep three \\nroubles for yourself at least, but he flung away all the twenty-\\nfive at once!’\\n‘Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know \\nnothing of it? So that’s why I was liberal yesterday…. Mr. \\nZametov knows I’ve found a treasure! Excuse us, please, for \\ndisturbing you for half an hour with such trivialities,’ he \\nsaid, turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with trembling lips. ‘We \\n\\uf646\\uf6491\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nare boring you, aren’t we?’\\n‘Oh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary! If only \\nyou knew how you interest me! It’s interesting to look on \\nand listen … and I am really glad you have come forward \\nat last.’\\n‘But you might give us some tea! My throat’s dry,’ cried \\nRazumihin.',\n",
              " '‘Capital idea! Perhaps we will all keep you company. \\nWouldn’t you like … something more essential before tea?’\\n‘Get along with you!’\\nPorfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea.\\nRaskolnikov’s thoughts were in a whirl. He was in ter-\\nrible exasperation.\\n‘The worst of it is they don’t disguise it; they don’t care \\nto stand on ceremony! And how if you didn’t know me at \\nall, did you come to talk to Nikodim Fomitch about me? \\nSo they don’t care to hide that they are tracking me like \\na pack of dogs. They simply spit in my face.’ He was shak-\\ning with rage. ‘Come, strike me openly, don’t play with me \\nlike a cat with a mouse. It’s hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, \\nbut perhaps I won’t allow it! I shall get up and throw the \\nwhole truth in your ugly faces, and you’ll see how I despise \\nyou.’ He could hardly breathe. ‘And what if it’s only my fan-\\ncy? What if I am mistaken, and through inexperience I get \\nangry and don’t keep up my nasty part? Perhaps it’s all un-\\nintentional. All their phrases are the usual ones, but there \\nis something about them…. It all might be said, but there \\nis something. Why did he say bluntly, ‘With her’? Why did \\nZametov add that I spoke artfully? Why do they speak in \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf649\\uf645\\nthat tone? Yes, the tone…. Razumihin is sitting here, why \\ndoes he see nothing? That innocent blockhead never does \\nsee anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just \\nnow? Of course it’s nonsense! What could he wink for? Are \\nthey trying to upset my nerves or are they teasing me? Ei-\\nther it’s ill fancy or they know! Even Zametov is rude…. Is \\nZametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind. I foresaw \\nhe would change his mind! He is at home here, while it’s \\nmy first visit. Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits \\nwith his back to him. They’re as thick as thieves, no doubt, \\nover me! Not a doubt they were talking about me before \\nwe came. Do they know about the flat? If only they’d make \\nhaste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he let it \\npass…. I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use \\nafterwards…. Delirious, indeed … ha-ha-ha! He knows all \\nabout last night! He didn’t know of my mother’s arrival! \\nThe hag had written the date on in pencil! You are wrong, \\nyou won’t catch me! There are no facts … it’s all supposition! \\nYou produce facts! The flat even isn’t a fact but delirium. I \\nknow what to say to them…. Do they know about the flat? I \\nwon’t go without finding out. What did I come for? But my \\nbeing angry now, maybe is a fact! Fool, how irritable I am! \\nPerhaps that’s right; to play the invalid…. He is feeling me. \\nHe will try to catch me. Why did I come?’\\nAll this flashed like lightning through his mind.\\nPorfiry Petrovitch returned quickly. He became sudden-\\nly more jovial.\\n‘Your party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather…. \\nAnd I am out of sorts altogether,’ he began in quite a differ-\\n\\uf646\\uf649\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nent tone, laughing to Razumihin.\\n‘Was it interesting? I left you yesterday at the most inter-\\nesting point. Who got the best of it?’\\n‘Oh, no one, of course. They got on to everlasting ques-\\ntions, floated off into space.’\\n‘Only fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday. Wheth-\\ner there is such a thing as crime. I told you that we talked \\nour heads off.’\\n‘What is there strange? It’s an everyday social question,’ \\nRaskolnikov answered casually.',\n",
              " '‘The question wasn’t put quite like that,’ observed Por-\\nfiry.\\n‘Not quite, that’s true,’ Razumihin agreed at once, get-\\nting warm and hurried as usual. ‘Listen, Rodion, and tell us \\nyour opinion, I want to hear it. I was fighting tooth and nail \\nwith them and wanted you to help me. I told them you were \\ncoming…. It began with the socialist doctrine. You know \\ntheir doctrine; crime is a protest against the abnormality \\nof the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing \\nmore; no other causes admitted! …’\\n‘You are wrong there,’ cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he was \\nnoticeably animated and kept laughing as he looked at Ra-\\nzumihin, which made him more excited than ever.\\n‘Nothing is admitted,’ Razumihin interrupted with heat.\\n‘I am not wrong. I’ll show you their pamphlets. Every-\\nthing with them is ‘the influence of environment,’ and \\nnothing else. Their favourite phrase! From which it follows \\nthat, if society is normally organised, all crime will cease at \\nonce, since there will be nothing to protest against and all \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf649\\uf647\\nmen will become righteous in one instant. Human nature \\nis not taken into account, it is excluded, it’s not supposed to \\nexist! They don’t recognise that humanity, developing by a \\nhistorical living process, will become at last a normal soci-\\nety, but they believe that a social system that has come out \\nof some mathematical brain is going to organise all human-\\nity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant, quicker \\nthan any living process! That’s why they instinctively dis-\\nlike history, ‘nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,’ and \\nthey explain it all as stupidity! That’s why they so dislike the \\nliving process of life; they don’t want a living soul! The living \\nsoul demands life, the soul won’t obey the rules of mechan-\\nics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! \\nBut what they want though it smells of death and can be \\nmade of India-rubber, at least is not alive, has no will, is \\nservile and won’t revolt! And it comes in the end to their re-\\nducing everything to the building of walls and the planning \\nof rooms and passages in a phalanstery! The phalanstery \\nis ready, indeed, but your human nature is not ready for \\nthe phalanstery—it wants life, it hasn’t completed its vital \\nprocess, it’s too soon for the graveyard! You can’t skip over \\nnature by logic. Logic presupposes three possibilities, but \\nthere are millions! Cut away a million, and reduce it all to \\nthe question of comfort! That’s the easiest solution of the \\nproblem! It’s seductively clear and you musn’t think about \\nit. That’s the great thing, you mustn’t think! The whole se-\\ncret of life in two pages of print!’\\n‘Now he is off, beating the drum! Catch hold of him, do!’ \\nlaughed Porfiry. ‘Can you imagine,’ he turned to Raskol-\\n\\uf646\\uf649\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nnikov, ‘six people holding forth like that last night, in one \\nroom, with punch as a preliminary! No, brother, you are \\nwrong, environment accounts for a great deal in crime; I \\ncan assure you of that.’\\n‘Oh, I know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty vio-\\nlates a child of ten; was it environment drove him to it?’\\n‘Well, strictly speaking, it did,’ Porfiry observed with \\nnoteworthy gravity; ‘a crime of that nature may be very well \\nascribed to the influence of environment.’\\nRazumihin was almost in a frenzy. ‘Oh, if you like,’ he \\nroared. ‘I’ll prove to you that your white eyelashes may very \\nwell be ascribed to the Church of Ivan the Great’s being \\ntwo hundred and fifty feet high, and I will prove it clearly, \\nexactly, progressively, and even with a Liberal tendency! I \\nundertake to! Will you bet on it?’\\n‘Done! Let’s hear, please, how he will prove it!’\\n‘He is always humbugging, confound him,’ cried Razu-\\nmihin, jumping up and gesticulating. ‘What’s the use of \\ntalking to you? He does all that on purpose; you don’t know \\nhim, Rodion! He took their side yesterday, simply to make \\nfools of them. And the things he said yesterday! And they \\nwere delighted! He can keep it up for a fortnight together. \\nLast year he persuaded us that he was going into a monas-\\ntery: he stuck to it for two months. Not long ago he took it \\ninto his head to declare he was going to get married, that \\nhe had everything ready for the wedding. He ordered new \\nclothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him. There \\nwas no bride, nothing, all pure fantasy!’\\n‘Ah, you are wrong! I got the clothes before. It was the \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf649\\uf649\\nnew clothes in fact that made me think of taking you in.’\\n‘Are you such a good dissembler?’ Raskolnikov asked \\ncarelessly.\\n‘You wouldn’t have supposed it, eh? Wait a bit, I shall \\ntake you in, too. Ha-ha-ha! No, I’ll tell you the truth. All \\nthese questions about crime, environment, children, recall \\nto my mind an article of yours which interested me at the \\ntime. ‘On Crime’ … or something of the sort, I forget the \\ntitle, I read it with pleasure two months ago in the Periodi-\\ncal Review. ’\\n‘My article? In the Periodical Review?’ Raskolnikov asked \\nin astonishment. ‘I certainly did write an article upon a \\nbook six months ago when I left the university, but I sent it \\nto the Weekly Review. ’\\n‘But it came out in the Periodical. ’\\n‘And the Weekly Review ceased to exist, so that’s why it \\nwasn’t printed at the time.’\\n‘That’s true; but when it ceased to exist, the Weekly Re-\\nview was amalgamated with the Periodical and so your \\narticle appeared two months ago in the latter. Didn’t you \\nknow?’\\nRaskolnikov had not known.',\n",
              " '‘Why, you might get some money out of them for the \\narticle! What a strange person you are! You lead such a soli-\\ntary life that you know nothing of matters that concern you \\ndirectly. It’s a fact, I assure you.’\\n‘Bravo, Rodya! I knew nothing about it either!’ cried Ra-\\nzumihin. ‘I’ll run to-day to the reading-room and ask for \\nthe number. Two months ago? What was the date? It doesn’t \\n\\uf646\\uf649\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nmatter though, I will find it. Think of not telling us!’\\n‘How did you find out that the article was mine? It’s only \\nsigned with an initial.’\\n‘I only learnt it by chance, the other day. Through the edi-\\ntor; I know him…. I was very much interested.’\\n‘I analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal \\nbefore and after the crime.’\\n‘Yes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime \\nis always accompanied by illness. Very, very original, but \\n… it was not that part of your article that interested me so \\nmuch, but an idea at the end of the article which I regret \\nto say you merely suggested without working it out clearly. \\nThere is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are certain \\npersons who can … that is, not precisely are able to, but \\nhave a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and \\ncrimes, and that the law is not for them.’\\nRaskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional \\ndistortion of his idea.\\n‘What? What do you mean? A right to crime? But not \\nbecause of the influence of environment?’ Razumihin in-\\nquired with some alarm even.\\n‘No, not exactly because of it,’ answered Porfiry. ‘In his \\narticle all men are divided into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordi-\\nnary.’ Ordinary men have to live in submission, have no \\nright to transgress the law, because, don’t you see, they are \\nordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to commit \\nany crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because \\nthey are extraordinary. That was your idea, if I am not mis-\\ntaken?’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf649\\uf64b\\n‘What do you mean? That can’t be right?’ Razumihin \\nmuttered in bewilderment.\\nRaskolnikov smiled again. He saw the point at once, and \\nknew where they wanted to drive him. He decided to take \\nup the challenge.\\n‘That wasn’t quite my contention,’ he began simply and \\nmodestly. ‘Yet I admit that you have stated it almost cor-\\nrectly; perhaps, if you like, perfectly so.’ (It almost gave \\nhim pleasure to admit this.) ‘The only difference is that I \\ndon’t contend that extraordinary people are always bound \\nto commit breaches of morals, as you call it. In fact, I doubt \\nwhether such an argument could be published. I simply \\nhinted that an ‘extraordinary’ man has the right … that \\nis not an official right, but an inner right to decide in his \\nown conscience to overstep … certain obstacles, and only \\nin case it is essential for the practical fulfilment of his idea \\n(sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity). \\nYou say that my article isn’t definite; I am ready to make it \\nas clear as I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want \\nme to; very well. I maintain that if the discoveries of Ke-\\npler and Newton could not have been made known except \\nby sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a hundred, or more \\nmen, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have \\nbeen in duty bound … to eliminate the dozen or the hun-\\ndred men for the sake of making his discoveries known to \\nthe whole of humanity. But it does not follow from that that \\nNewton had a right to murder people right and left and to \\nsteal every day in the market. Then, I remember, I main-\\ntain in my article that all … well, legislators and leaders of \\n\\uf646\\uf649\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nmen, such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and \\nso on, were all without exception criminals, from the very \\nfact that, making a new law, they transgressed the ancient \\none, handed down from their ancestors and held sacred \\nby the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed ei-\\nther, if that bloodshed—often of innocent persons fighting \\nbravely in defence of ancient law—were of use to their cause. \\nIt’s remarkable, in fact, that the majority, indeed, of these \\nbenefactors and leaders of humanity were guilty of terrible \\ncarnage. In short, I maintain that all great men or even men \\na little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving \\nsome new word, must from their very nature be criminals—\\nmore or less, of course. Otherwise it’s hard for them to get \\nout of the common rut; and to remain in the common rut is \\nwhat they can’t submit to, from their very nature again, and \\nto my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to it. You see \\nthat there is nothing particularly new in all that.',\n",
              " 'The same \\nthing has been printed and read a thousand times before. \\nAs for my division of people into ordinary and extraordi-\\nnary, I acknowledge that it’s somewhat arbitrary, but I don’t \\ninsist upon exact numbers. I only believe in my leading \\nidea that men are in general divided by a law of nature into \\ntwo categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say, mate-\\nrial that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who \\nhave the gift or the talent to utter a new word. There are, of \\ncourse, innumerable sub- divisions, but the distinguishing \\nfeatures of both categories are fairly well marked. The first \\ncategory, generally speaking, are men conservative in tem-\\nperament and law-abiding; they live under control and love \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf64a0\\nto be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty to be con-\\ntrolled, because that’s their vocation, and there is nothing \\nhumiliating in it for them. The second category all trans-\\ngress the law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction \\naccording to their capacities. The crimes of these men are \\nof course relative and varied; for the most part they seek in \\nvery varied ways the destruction of the present for the sake \\nof the better. But if such a one is forced for the sake of his \\nidea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I \\nmaintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction \\nfor wading through blood—that depends on the idea and \\nits dimensions, note that. It’s only in that sense I speak of \\ntheir right to crime in my article (you remember it began \\nwith the legal question). There’s no need for such anxiety, \\nhowever; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right, they \\npunish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so \\nfulfil quite justly their conservative vocation. But the same \\nmasses set these criminals on a pedestal in the next genera-\\ntion and worship them (more or less). The first category is \\nalways the man of the present, the second the man of the \\nfuture. The first preserve the world and people it, the sec-\\nond move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has \\nan equal right to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with \\nme—and vive la guerre éternelle—till the New Jerusalem, \\nof course!’\\n‘Then you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?’\\n‘I do,’ Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these \\nwords and during the whole preceding tirade he kept his \\neyes on one spot on the carpet.\\n\\uf646\\uf64a1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘And … and do you believe in God? Excuse my curios-\\nity.’\\n‘I do,’ repeated Raskolnikov, raising his eyes to Porfiry.\\n‘And … do you believe in Lazarus’ rising from the dead?’\\n‘I … I do. Why do you ask all this?’\\n‘You believe it literally?’\\n‘Literally.’\\n‘You don’t say so…. I asked from curiosity. Excuse me. \\nBut let us go back to the question; they are not always ex-\\necuted. Some, on the contrary …’\\n‘Triumph in their lifetime? Oh, yes, some attain their \\nends in this life, and then …’\\n‘They begin executing other people?’\\n‘If it’s necessary; indeed, for the most part they do. Your \\nremark is very witty.’\\n‘Thank you. But tell me this: how do you distinguish \\nthose extraordinary people from the ordinary ones? Are \\nthere signs at their birth? I feel there ought to be more exac-\\ntitude, more external definition. Excuse the natural anxiety \\nof a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn’t they adopt \\na special uniform, for instance, couldn’t they wear some-\\nthing, be branded in some way? For you know if confusion \\narises and a member of one category imagines that he be-\\nlongs to the other, begins to ‘eliminate obstacles’ as you so \\nhappily expressed it, then …’\\n‘Oh, that very often happens! That remark is wittier than \\nthe other.’\\n‘Thank you.’\\n‘No reason to; but take note that the mistake can only \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf64a\\uf645\\narise in the first category, that is among the ordinary people \\n(as I perhaps unfortunately called them). In spite of their \\npredisposition to obedience very many of them, through \\na playfulness of nature, sometimes vouchsafed even to the \\ncow, like to imagine themselves advanced people, ‘destroy-\\ners,’ and to push themselves into the ‘new movement,’ and \\nthis quite sincerely. Meanwhile the really new people are \\nvery often unobserved by them, or even despised as reac-\\ntionaries of grovelling tendencies. But I don’t think there \\nis any considerable danger here, and you really need not \\nbe uneasy for they never go very far. Of course, they might \\nhave a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away \\nwith them and to teach them their place, but no more; in \\nfact, even this isn’t necessary as they castigate themselves, \\nfor they are very conscientious: some perform this service \\nfor one another and others chastise themselves with their \\nown hands…. They will impose various public acts of peni-\\ntence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying effect; \\nin fact you’ve nothing to be uneasy about…. It’s a law of \\nnature.’\\n‘Well, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on \\nthat score; but there’s another thing worries me. Tell me, \\nplease, are there many people who have the right to kill oth-\\ners, these extraordinary people? I am ready to bow down to \\nthem, of course, but you must admit it’s alarming if there \\nare a great many of them, eh?’\\n‘Oh, you needn’t worry about that either,’ Raskolnikov \\nwent on in the same tone.',\n",

That law, of course, is unknown \\nat present, but I am convinced that it exists, and one day \\nmay become known. The vast mass of mankind is mere \\nmaterial, and only exists in order by some great effort, by \\nsome mysterious process, by means of some crossing of rac-\\nes and stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one \\nman out of a thousand with a spark of independence.

He saw him turn round \\nfifty paces away and look back at him still standing there. \\nRaskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that he \\nwas again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and tri-\\numph.\\nWith slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskol-\\nnikov made his way back to his little garret, feeling chilled \\nall over. He took off his cap and put it on the table, and \\nfor ten minutes he stood without moving. Then he sank \\nexhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he \\nstretched himself on it. So he lay for half an hour.\\nHe thought of nothing. Some thoughts or fragments of \\nthoughts, some images without order or coherence floated \\nbefore his mind—faces of people he had seen in his child-\\nhood or met somewhere once, whom he would never have \\nrecalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard table in \\na restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of \\ncigars in some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, \\na back staircase quite dark, all sloppy with dirty water and \\nstrewn with egg-shells, and the Sunday bells floating in from \\nsomewhere…. The images followed one another, whirling \\nlike a hurricane. Some of them he liked and tried to clutch \\nat, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression \\nwithin him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was \\neven pleasant…. The slight shivering still persisted, but that \\ntoo was an almost pleasant sensation.\\nHe heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed \\nhis eyes and pretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf64b\\uf64b\\ndoor and stood for some time in the doorway as though \\nhesitating, then he stepped softly into the room and went \\ncautiously to the sofa. Raskolnikov heard Nastasya’s whis-\\nper:\\n‘Don’t disturb him! Let him sleep. He can have his din-\\nner later.’\\n‘Quite so,’ answered Razumihin. Both withdrew carefully \\nand closed the door. Another half-hour passed. Raskol-\\nnikov opened his eyes, turned on his back again, clasping \\nhis hands behind his head.\\n‘Who is he? Who is that man who sprang out of the earth? \\nWhere was he, what did he see? He has seen it all, that’s clear. \\nWhere was he then? And from where did he see? Why has \\nhe only now sprung out of the earth? And how could he see? \\nIs it possible? Hm …’ continued Raskolnikov, turning cold \\nand shivering, ‘and the jewel case Nikolay found behind the \\ndoor—was that possible? A clue? You miss an infinitesimal \\nline and you can build it into a pyramid of evidence! A fly \\nflew by and saw it! Is it possible?’ He felt with sudden loath-\\ning how weak, how physically weak he had become. ‘I ought \\nto have known it,’ he thought with a bitter smile. ‘And how \\ndared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take \\nup an axe and shed blood! I ought to have known before-\\nhand…. Ah, but I did know!’ he whispered in despair. At \\ntimes he came to a standstill at some thought.\\n‘No, those men are not made so. The real Master to whom \\nall is permitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, \\nforgets an army in Egypt, wastes half a million men in the \\nMoscow expedition and gets off with a jest at Vilna.',\n",

Na-\\npoleon, the pyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old \\nwoman, a pawnbroker with a red trunk under her bed—it’s \\na nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to digest! How can they \\ndigest it! It’s too inartistic. ‘A Napoleon creep under an old \\nwoman’s bed! Ugh, how loathsome!’\\nAt moments he felt he was raving. He sank into a state of \\nfeverish excitement. ‘The old woman is of no consequence,’ \\nhe thought, hotly and incoherently. ‘The old woman was a \\nmistake perhaps, but she is not what matters! The old wom-\\nan was only an illness…. I was in a hurry to overstep…. I \\ndidn’t kill a human being, but a principle! I killed the prin-\\nciple, but I didn’t overstep, I stopped on this side…. I was \\nonly capable of killing. And it seems I wasn’t even capable \\nof that … Principle? Why was that fool Razumihin abus-\\ning the socialists? They are industrious, commercial people; \\n‘the happiness of all’ is their case. No, life is only given to \\nme once and I shall never have it again; I don’t want to wait \\nfor ‘the happiness of all.’ I want to live myself, or else better \\nnot live at all. I simply couldn’t pass by my mother starving, \\nkeeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the ‘hap-\\npiness of all.’ I am putting my little brick into the happiness \\nof all and so my heart is at peace. Ha-ha! Why have you let \\nme slip? I only live once, I too want…. Ech, I am an æsthetic \\nlouse and nothing more,’ he added suddenly, laughing like a \\nmadman. ‘Yes, I am certainly a louse,’ he went on, clutching \\nat the idea, gloating over it and playing with it with vindic-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf64c0\\ntive pleasure. ‘In the first place, because I can reason that I \\nam one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been \\ntroubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that \\nnot for my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a \\ngrand and noble object— ha-ha! Thirdly, because I aimed \\nat carrying it out as justly as possible, weighing, measuring \\nand calculating. Of all the lice I picked out the most useless \\none and proposed to take from her only as much as I needed \\nfor the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have \\ngone to a monastery, according to her will, ha-ha!). And \\nwhat shows that I am utterly a louse,’ he added, grinding his \\nteeth, ‘is that I am perhaps viler and more loathsome than \\nthe louse I killed, and I felt beforehand that I should tell my-\\nself so after killing her. Can anything be compared with the \\nhorror of that? The vulgarity! The abjectness! I understand \\nthe ‘prophet’ with his sabre, on his steed: Allah commands \\nand ‘trembling’ creation must obey! The ‘prophet’ is right, \\nhe is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows \\nup the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain! \\nIt’s for you to obey, trembling creation, and not to have de-\\nsires for that’s not for you! … I shall never, never forgive the \\nold woman!’\\nHis hair was soaked with sweat, his quivering lips were \\nparched, his eyes were fixed on the ceiling.\\n‘Mother, sister—how I loved them! Why do I hate them \\nnow? Yes, I hate them, I feel a physical hatred for them, I \\ncan’t bear them near me…. I went up to my mother and \\nkissed her, I remember…. To embrace her and think if she \\nonly knew … shall I tell her then? That’s just what I might \\n\\uf646\\uf64c1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ndo…. She must be the same as I am,’ he added, straining \\nhimself to think, as it were struggling with delirium. ‘Ah, \\nhow I hate the old woman now! I feel I should kill her again \\nif she came to life! Poor Lizaveta! Why did she come in? \\n… It’s strange though, why is it I scarcely ever think of her, \\nas though I hadn’t killed her? Lizaveta! Sonia! Poor gentle \\nthings, with gentle eyes…. Dear women! Why don’t they \\nweep? Why don’t they moan? They give up everything … \\ntheir eyes are soft and gentle…. Sonia, Sonia! Gentle So-\\nnia!’\\nHe lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that \\nhe didn’t remember how he got into the street. It was late \\nevening. The twilight had fallen and the full moon was \\nshining more and more brightly; but there was a peculiar \\nbreathlessness in the air. There were crowds of people in \\nthe street; workmen and business people were making their \\nway home; other people had come out for a walk; there was \\na smell of mortar, dust and stagnant water. Raskolnikov \\nwalked along, mournful and anxious; he was distinctly \\naware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do \\nsomething in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten. Sud-\\ndenly he stood still and saw a man standing on the other \\nside of the street, beckoning to him. He crossed over to him, \\nbut at once the man turned and walked away with his head \\nhanging, as though he had made no sign to him. ‘Stay, did \\nhe really beckon?’ Raskolnikov wondered, but he tried to \\novertake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised \\nhim and was frightened; it was the same man with stooping \\nshoulders in the long coat. Raskolnikov followed him at a \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf64c\\uf645\\ndistance; his heart was beating; they went down a turning; \\nthe man still did not look round.',\n",
              " '‘Does he know I am fol-\\nlowing him?’ thought Raskolnikov. The man went into the \\ngateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate \\nand looked in to see whether he would look round and sign \\nto him. In the court-yard the man did turn round and again \\nseemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov at once followed him \\ninto the yard, but the man was gone. He must have gone \\nup the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He \\nheard slow measured steps two flights above. The staircase \\nseemed strangely familiar. He reached the window on the \\nfirst floor; the moon shone through the panes with a melan-\\ncholy and mysterious light; then he reached the second floor. \\nBah! this is the flat where the painters were at work … but \\nhow was it he did not recognise it at once? The steps of the \\nman above had died away. ‘So he must have stopped or hid-\\nden somewhere.’ He reached the third storey, should he go \\non? There was a stillness that was dreadful…. But he went \\non. The sound of his own footsteps scared and frightened \\nhim. How dark it was! The man must be hiding in some cor-\\nner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he hesitated \\nand went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage, as \\nthough everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe \\ninto the parlour which was flooded with moonlight. Every-\\nthing there was as before, the chairs, the looking-glass, the \\nyellow sofa and the pictures in the frames. A huge, round, \\ncopper-red moon looked in at the windows. ‘It’s the moon \\nthat makes it so still, weaving some mystery,’ thought Ras-\\nkolnikov. He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the \\n\\uf646\\uf64c\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nmore silent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, \\ntill it was painful. And still the same hush. Suddenly he \\nheard a momentary sharp crack like the snapping of a splin-\\nter and all was still again. A fly flew up suddenly and struck \\nthe window pane with a plaintive buzz. At that moment he \\nnoticed in the corner between the window and the little \\ncupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. ‘Why \\nis that cloak here?’ he thought, ‘it wasn’t there before….’ He \\nwent up to it quietly and felt that there was someone hiding \\nbehind it. He cautiously moved the cloak and saw, sitting on \\na chair in the corner, the old woman bent double so that he \\ncouldn’t see her face; but it was she. He stood over her. ‘She \\nis afraid,’ he thought. He stealthily took the axe from the \\nnoose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. \\nBut strange to say she did not stir, as though she were made \\nof wood. He was frightened, bent down nearer and tried to \\nlook at her; but she, too, bent her head lower. He bent right \\ndown to the ground and peeped up into her face from be-\\nlow, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old woman \\nwas sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, \\ndoing her utmost that he should not hear it. Suddenly he \\nfancied that the door from the bedroom was opened a little \\nand that there was laughter and whispering within. He was \\novercome with frenzy and he began hitting the old woman \\non the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axe \\nthe laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder \\nand the old woman was simply shaking with mirth. He was \\nrushing away, but the passage was full of people, the doors \\nof the flats stood open and on the landing, on the stairs \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf64c\\uf647\\nand everywhere below there were people, rows of heads, \\nall looking, but huddled together in silence and expecta-\\ntion. Something gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to \\nthe spot, they would not move….',\n",

He lay on his back without stirring.\\n‘Is it still a dream?’ he wondered and again raised his \\neyelids hardly perceptibly; the stranger was standing in the \\nsame place, still watching him.\\nHe stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing \\nthe door after him, went up to the table, paused a moment, \\nstill keeping his eyes on Raskolnikov, and noiselessly seated \\nhimself on the chair by the sofa; he put his hat on the floor \\nbeside him and leaned his hands on his cane and his chin \\non his hands. It was evident that he was prepared to wait \\nindefinitely. As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his \\nstolen glances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a \\nfull, fair, almost whitish beard.\\nTen minutes passed.

In the first place, I want-\\ned to make your personal acquaintance, as I have already \\nheard a great deal about you that is interesting and flatter-\\ning; secondly, I cherish the hope that you may not refuse to \\nassist me in a matter directly concerning the welfare of your \\nsister, Avdotya Romanovna. For without your support she \\nmight not let me come near her now, for she is prejudiced \\nagainst me, but with your assistance I reckon on …’\\n‘You reckon wrongly,’ interrupted Raskolnikov.\\n‘They only arrived yesterday, may I ask you?’\\nRaskolnikov made no reply.\\n‘It was yesterday, I know. I only arrived myself the day \\nbefore. Well, let me tell you this, Rodion Romanovitch, I \\ndon’t consider it necessary to justify myself, but kindly tell \\nme what was there particularly criminal on my part in all \\nthis business, speaking without prejudice, with common \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf646\\uf64c\\uf64b\\nsense?’\\nRaskolnikov continued to look at him in silence.\\n‘That in my own house I persecuted a defenceless girl and \\n‘insulted her with my infamous proposals’—is that it? (I am \\nanticipating you.) But you’ve only to assume that I, too, am \\na man et nihil humanum … in a word, that I am capable of \\nbeing attracted and falling in love (which does not depend \\non our will), then everything can be explained in the most \\nnatural manner. The question is, am I a monster, or am I \\nmyself a victim? And what if I am a victim? In proposing \\nto the object of my passion to elope with me to America or \\nSwitzerland, I may have cherished the deepest respect for \\nher and may have thought that I was promoting our mutual \\nhappiness! Reason is the slave of passion, you know; why, \\nprobably, I was doing more harm to myself than anyone!’\\n‘But that’s not the point,’ Raskolnikov interrupted with \\ndisgust. ‘It’s simply that whether you are right or wrong, we \\ndislike you. We don’t want to have anything to do with you. \\nWe show you the door. Go out!’\\nSvidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh.\\n‘But you’re … but there’s no getting round you,’ he said, \\nlaughing in the frankest way. ‘I hoped to get round you, but \\nyou took up the right line at once!’\\n‘But you are trying to get round me still!’\\n‘What of it?

Not to speak of the \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64700\\nfact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to \\nbe insulted in spite of all their show of indignation. There \\nare instances of it with everyone; human beings in general, \\nindeed, greatly love to be insulted, have you noticed that? \\nBut it’s particularly so with women. One might even say it’s \\ntheir only amusement.’\\nAt one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walk-\\ning out and so finishing the interview. But some curiosity \\nand even a sort of prudence made him linger for a moment.\\n‘You are fond of fighting?’ he asked carelessly.\\n‘No, not very,’ Svidrigaïlov answered, calmly. ‘And Marfa \\nPetrovna and I scarcely ever fought.

The first time, \\ntwo months after our marriage, immediately after we ar-\\nrived in the country, and the last time was that of which we \\nare speaking.

By the way, do \\nyou remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few years ago, \\nin those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, I’ve for-\\ngotten his name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the \\npapers, for having thrashed a German woman in the rail-\\nway train. You remember? It was in those days, that very \\nyear I believe, the ‘disgraceful action of the Age’ took place \\n(you know, ‘The Egyptian Nights,’ that public reading, you \\nremember?

But I must say \\nthat there are sometimes such provoking ‘Germans’ that I \\ndon’t believe there is a progressive who could quite answer \\nfor himself. No one looked at the subject from that point of \\nview then, but that’s the truly humane point of view, I as-\\nsure you.’\\nAfter saying this, Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh \\nagain. Raskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a \\nfirm purpose in his mind and able to keep it to himself.\\n‘I expect you’ve not talked to anyone for some days?’ he \\nasked.\\n‘Scarcely anyone. I suppose you are wondering at my be-\\ning such an adaptable man?’\\n‘No, I am only wondering at your being too adaptable a \\nman.’\\n‘Because I am not offended at the rudeness of your ques-\\ntions? Is that it? But why take offence? As you asked, so I \\nanswered,’ he replied, with a surprising expression of sim-\\nplicity. ‘You know, there’s hardly anything I take interest in,’ \\nhe went on, as it were dreamily, ‘especially now, I’ve nothing \\nto do….

There was a regular set of us, \\nmen of the best society, eight years ago; we had a fine time. \\nAnd all men of breeding, you know, poets, men of property. \\nAnd indeed as a rule in our Russian society the best manners \\nare found among those who’ve been thrashed, have you no-\\nticed that? I’ve deteriorated in the country. But I did get into \\nprison for debt, through a low Greek who came from Ne-\\nzhin. Then Marfa Petrovna turned up; she bargained with \\nhim and bought me off for thirty thousand silver pieces (I \\nowed seventy thousand). We were united in lawful wedlock \\nand she bore me off into the country like a treasure. You \\nknow she was five years older than I. She was very fond of \\nme. For seven years I never left the country. And, take note, \\nthat all my life she held a document over me, the IOU for \\nthirty thousand roubles, so if I were to elect to be restive \\nabout anything I should be trapped at once!

It was scarcely the document \\nrestrained me. I didn’t want to go anywhere else. Mar-\\nfa Petrovna herself invited me to go abroad, seeing I was \\nbored, but I’ve been abroad before, and always felt sick \\nthere. For no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of Naples, the \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6470\\uf647\\nsea—you look at them and it makes you sad. What’s most \\nrevolting is that one is really sad! No, it’s better at home. \\nHere at least one blames others for everything and excuses \\noneself.

I really don’t know….’ Svidrigaïlov \\nmuttered ingenuously, as though he, too, were puzzled.\\nFor a minute they were silent. They stared in each other’s \\nfaces.\\n‘That’s all nonsense!’ Raskolnikov shouted with vexation. \\n‘What does she say when she comes to you?’\\n‘She! Would you believe it, she talks of the silliest trifles \\nand—man is a strange creature—it makes me angry.',\n",
              " 'The \\nfirst time she came in (I was tired you know: the funeral \\nservice, the funeral ceremony, the lunch afterwards. At last \\nI was left alone in my study. I lighted a cigar and began to \\nthink), she came in at the door. ‘You’ve been so busy to-day, \\nArkady Ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the din-\\ning- room clock,’ she said. All those seven years I’ve wound \\nthat clock every week, and if I forgot it she would always \\nremind me. The next day I set off on my way here. I got out \\nat the station at daybreak; I’d been asleep, tired out, with \\nmy eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee. I looked up \\nand there was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me \\nwith a pack of cards in her hands. ‘Shall I tell your fortune \\nfor the journey, Arkady Ivanovitch?’ She was a great hand \\nat telling fortunes. I shall never forgive myself for not ask-\\ning her to. I ran away in a fright, and, besides, the bell rang. \\n\\uf6470\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nI was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after a miserable \\ndinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a sud-\\nden Marfa Petrovna again. She came in very smart in a new \\ngreen silk dress with a long train. ‘Good day, Arkady Iva-\\nnovitch! How do you like my dress? Aniska can’t make like \\nthis.’ (Aniska was a dressmaker in the country, one of our \\nformer serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a pretty \\nwench.) She stood turning round before me. I looked at the \\ndress, and then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face. \\n‘I wonder you trouble to come to me about such trifles, Mar-\\nfa Petrovna.’ ‘Good gracious, you won’t let one disturb you \\nabout anything!’ To tease her I said, ‘I want to get married, \\nMarfa Petrovna.’ ‘That’s just like you, Arkady Ivanovitch; it \\ndoes you very little credit to come looking for a bride when \\nyou’ve hardly buried your wife. And if you could make a \\ngood choice, at least, but I know it won’t be for your happi-\\nness or hers, you will only be a laughing-stock to all good \\npeople.’ Then she went out and her train seemed to rustle. \\nIsn’t it nonsense, eh?’\\n‘But perhaps you are telling lies?’ Raskolnikov put in.\\n‘I rarely lie,’ answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully, appar-\\nently not noticing the rudeness of the question.\\n‘And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?’\\n‘Y-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six \\nyears ago. I had a serf, Filka; just after his burial I called \\nout forgetting ‘Filka, my pipe!’ He came in and went to the \\ncupboard where my pipes were. I sat still and thought ‘he \\nis doing it out of revenge,’ because we had a violent quarrel \\njust before his death. ‘How dare you come in with a hole in \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6470\\uf64b\\nyour elbow?’ I said. ‘Go away, you scamp!’ He turned and \\nwent out, and never came again. I didn’t tell Marfa Petro-\\nvna at the time. I wanted to have a service sung for him, but \\nI was ashamed.’\\n‘You should go to a doctor.’\\n‘I know I am not well, without your telling me, though I \\ndon’t know what’s wrong; I believe I am five times as strong \\nas you are. I didn’t ask you whether you believe that ghosts \\nare seen, but whether you believe that they exist.’\\n‘No, I won’t believe it!’ Raskolnikov cried, with positive \\nanger.\\n‘What do people generally say?’ muttered Svidrigaïlov, as \\nthough speaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his \\nhead. ‘They say, ‘You are ill, so what appears to you is only \\nunreal fantasy.’ But that’s not strictly logical. I agree that \\nghosts only appear to the sick, but that only proves that they \\nare unable to appear except to the sick, not that they don’t \\nexist.',\n",
              " '’\\n‘Nothing of the sort,’ Raskolnikov insisted irritably.\\n‘No? You don’t think so?’ Svidrigaïlov went on, looking \\nat him deliberately. ‘But what do you say to this argument \\n(help me with it): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and frag-\\nments of other worlds, the beginning of them. A man in \\nhealth has, of course, no reason to see them, because he is \\nabove all a man of this earth and is bound for the sake of \\ncompleteness and order to live only in this life. But as soon \\nas one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the or-\\nganism is broken, one begins to realise the possibility of \\nanother world; and the more seriously ill one is, the closer \\n\\uf6470\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nbecomes one’s contact with that other world, so that as soon \\nas the man dies he steps straight into that world. I thought \\nof that long ago. If you believe in a future life, you could be-\\nlieve in that, too.’\\n‘I don’t believe in a future life,’ said Raskolnikov.\\nSvidrigaïlov sat lost in thought.\\n‘And what if there are only spiders there, or something of \\nthat sort,’ he said suddenly.\\n‘He is a madman,’ thought Raskolnikov.\\n‘We always imagine eternity as something beyond our \\nconception, something vast, vast! But why must it be vast? \\nInstead of all that, what if it’s one little room, like a bath \\nhouse in the country, black and grimy and spiders in every \\ncorner, and that’s all eternity is? I sometimes fancy it like \\nthat.’\\n‘Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more \\ncomforting than that?’ Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of \\nanguish.\\n‘Juster? And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and \\ndo you know it’s what I would certainly have made it,’ an-\\nswered Svidrigaïlov, with a vague smile.\\nThis horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskol-\\nnikov. Svidrigaïlov raised his head, looked at him, and \\nsuddenly began laughing.\\n‘Only think,’ he cried, ‘half an hour ago we had never \\nseen each other, we regarded each other as enemies; there \\nis a matter unsettled between us; we’ve thrown it aside, and \\naway we’ve gone into the abstract! Wasn’t I right in saying \\nthat we were birds of a feather?’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64710\\n‘Kindly allow me,’ Raskolnikov went on irritably, ‘to ask \\nyou to explain why you have honoured me with your visit … \\nand … and I am in a hurry, I have no time to waste. I want \\nto go out.’\\n‘By all means, by all means. Your sister, Avdotya Ro-\\nmanovna, is going to be married to Mr. Luzhin, Pyotr \\nPetrovitch?’\\n‘Can you refrain from any question about my sister and \\nfrom mentioning her name? I can’t understand how you \\ndare utter her name in my presence, if you really are Svid-\\nrigaïlov.’\\n‘Why, but I’ve come here to speak about her; how can I \\navoid mentioning her?’\\n‘Very good, speak, but make haste.’\\n‘I am sure that you must have formed your own opinion \\nof this Mr. Luzhin, who is a connection of mine through my \\nwife, if you have only seen him for half an hour, or heard any \\nfacts about him. He is no match for Avdotya Romanovna. \\nI believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing herself gener-\\nously and imprudently for the sake of … for the sake of her \\nfamily. I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would \\nbe very glad if the match could be broken off without the \\nsacrifice of worldly advantages. Now I know you personally, \\nI am convinced of it.’\\n‘All this is very naïve … excuse me, I should have said im-\\npudent on your part,’ said Raskolnikov.\\n‘You mean to say that I am seeking my own ends. Don’t \\nbe uneasy, Rodion Romanovitch, if I were working for my \\nown advantage, I would not have spoken out so directly. I \\n\\uf64711\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nam not quite a fool. I will confess something psychologically \\ncurious about that: just now, defending my love for Avdotya \\nRomanovna, I said I was myself the victim. Well, let me tell \\nyou that I’ve no feeling of love now, not the slightest, so that \\nI wonder myself indeed, for I really did feel something …’\\n‘Through idleness and depravity,’ Raskolnikov put in.\\n‘I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has \\nsuch qualities that even I could not help being impressed by \\nthem. But that’s all nonsense, as I see myself now.’\\n‘Have you seen that long?’\\n‘I began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly \\nsure of it the day before yesterday, almost at the moment \\nI arrived in Petersburg. I still fancied in Moscow, though, \\nthat I was coming to try to get Avdotya Romanovna’s hand \\nand to cut out Mr.',\n",
              " 'Luzhin.’\\n‘Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and \\ncome to the object of your visit. I am in a hurry, I want to \\ngo out …’\\n‘With the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and de-\\ntermining on a certain … journey, I should like to make \\nsome necessary preliminary arrangements. I left my chil-\\ndren with an aunt; they are well provided for; and they have \\nno need of me personally. And a nice father I should make, \\ntoo! I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me \\na year ago. That’s enough for me. Excuse me, I am just com-\\ning to the point. Before the journey which may come off, \\nI want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too. It’s not that I detest him \\nso much, but it was through him I quarrelled with Marfa \\nPetrovna when I learned that she had dished up this mar-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6471\\uf645\\nriage. I want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your \\nmediation, and if you like in your presence, to explain to \\nher that in the first place she will never gain anything but \\nharm from Mr. Luzhin. Then, begging her pardon for all \\npast unpleasantness, to make her a present of ten thousand \\nroubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture \\nto which I believe she is herself not disinclined, if she could \\nsee the way to it.’\\n‘You are certainly mad,’ cried Raskolnikov not so much \\nangered as astonished. ‘How dare you talk like that!’\\n‘I knew you would scream at me; but in the first place, \\nthough I am not rich, this ten thousand roubles is perfectly \\nfree; I have absolutely no need for it. If Avdotya Romanovna \\ndoes not accept it, I shall waste it in some more foolish way. \\nThat’s the first thing. Secondly, my conscience is perfect-\\nly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive. You may \\nnot believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you \\nwill know. The point is, that I did actually cause your sister, \\nwhom I greatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, \\nand so, sincerely regretting it, I want—not to compensate, \\nnot to repay her for the unpleasantness, but simply to do \\nsomething to her advantage, to show that I am not, after all, \\nprivileged to do nothing but harm. If there were a millionth \\nfraction of self-interest in my offer, I should not have made \\nit so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thou-\\nsand only, when five weeks ago I offered her more, Besides, I \\nmay, perhaps, very soon marry a young lady, and that alone \\nought to prevent suspicion of any design on Avdotya Ro-\\nmanovna. In conclusion, let me say that in marrying Mr. \\n\\uf6471\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nLuzhin, she is taking money just the same, only from an-\\nother man. Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, think it \\nover coolly and quietly.’\\nSvidrigaïlov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as \\nhe was saying this.\\n‘I beg you to say no more,’ said Raskolnikov. ‘In any case \\nthis is unpardonable impertinence.’\\n‘Not in the least. Then a man may do nothing but harm \\nto his neighbour in this world, and is prevented from do-\\ning the tiniest bit of good by trivial conventional formalities. \\nThat’s absurd. If I died, for instance, and left that sum to \\nyour sister in my will, surely she wouldn’t refuse it?’\\n‘Very likely she would.’\\n‘Oh, no, indeed. However, if you refuse it, so be it, though \\nten thousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion. \\nIn any case I beg you to repeat what I have said to Avdotya \\nRomanovna.’\\n‘No, I won’t.’\\n‘In that case, Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be obliged to \\ntry and see her myself and worry her by doing so.’\\n‘And if I do tell her, will you not try to see her?’\\n‘I don’t know really what to say.',\n",
              " 'I should like very much \\nto see her once more.’\\n‘Don’t hope for it.’\\n‘I’m sorry. But you don’t know me. Perhaps we may be-\\ncome better friends.’\\n‘You think we may become friends?’\\n‘And why not?’ Svidrigaïlov said, smiling. He stood up \\nand took his hat. ‘I didn’t quite intend to disturb you and \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6471\\uf647\\nI came here without reckoning on it … though I was very \\nmuch struck by your face this morning.’\\n‘Where did you see me this morning?’ Raskolnikov asked \\nuneasily.\\n‘I saw you by chance…. I kept fancying there is some-\\nthing about you like me…. But don’t be uneasy. I am not \\nintrusive; I used to get on all right with card-sharpers, and \\nI never bored Prince Svirbey, a great personage who is a \\ndistant relation of mine, and I could write about Rapha-\\nel’s Madonna in Madam Prilukov’s album, and I never left \\nMarfa Petrovna’s side for seven years, and I used to stay the \\nnight at Viazemsky’s house in the Hay Market in the old \\ndays, and I may go up in a balloon with Berg, perhaps.’\\n‘Oh, all right. Are you starting soon on your travels, may \\nI ask?’\\n‘What travels?’\\n‘Why, on that ‘journey’; you spoke of it yourself.’\\n‘A journey? Oh, yes. I did speak of a journey. Well, that’s \\na wide subject…. if only you knew what you are asking,’ he \\nadded, and gave a sudden, loud, short laugh. ‘Perhaps I’ll \\nget married instead of the journey. They’re making a match \\nfor me.’\\n‘Here?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘How have you had time for that?’\\n‘But I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once. \\nI earnestly beg it. Well, good-bye for the present. Oh, yes. I \\nhave forgotten something. Tell your sister, Rodion Roma-\\nnovitch, that Marfa Petrovna remembered her in her will \\n\\uf6471\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nand left her three thousand roubles. That’s absolutely cer-\\ntain. Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her death, \\nand it was done in my presence.

              " 'Through \\nhis persecuting her with his attentions, she was turned out \\nby his wife, Marfa Petrovna.

He came here at once af-\\nter his wife’s funeral. He is very strange, and is determined \\non doing something…. We must guard Dounia from him … \\nthat’s what I wanted to tell you, do you hear?’\\n‘Guard her! What can he do to harm Avdotya Romanov-\\nna? Thank you, Rodya, for speaking to me like that…. We \\nwill, we will guard her. Where does he live?’\\n‘I don’t know.’\\n‘Why didn’t you ask? What a pity! I’ll find out, though.’\\n‘Did you see him?’ asked Raskolnikov after a pause.\\n‘Yes, I noticed him, I noticed him well.’\\n‘You did really see him? You saw him clearly?’ Raskol-\\nnikov insisted.\\n‘Yes, I remember him perfectly, I should know him in a \\n\\uf6471\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthousand; I have a good memory for faces.’\\nThey were silent again.\\n‘Hm! … that’s all right,’ muttered Raskolnikov. ‘Do you \\nknow, I fancied … I keep thinking that it may have been an \\nhallucination.’\\n‘What do you mean? I don’t understand you.’\\n‘Well, you all say,’ Raskolnikov went on, twisting his \\nmouth into a smile, ‘that I am mad. I thought just now that \\nperhaps I really am mad, and have only seen a phantom.’\\n‘What do you mean?’\\n‘Why, who can tell? Perhaps I am really mad, and per-\\nhaps everything that happened all these days may be only \\nimagination.’\\n‘Ach, Rodya, you have been upset again! … But what did \\nhe say, what did he come for?’\\nRaskolnikov did not answer. Razumihin thought a min-\\nute.\\n‘Now let me tell you my story,’ he began, ‘I came to you, \\nyou were asleep. Then we had dinner and then I went to \\nPorfiry’s, Zametov was still with him. I tried to begin, but \\nit was no use. I couldn’t speak in the right way. They don’t \\nseem to understand and can’t understand, but are not a bit \\nashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking \\nto him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked \\naway. At last I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him \\nas a cousin I’d brain him. He merely looked at me, I cursed \\nand came away. That was all. It was very stupid. To Zametov \\nI didn’t say a word. But, you see, I thought I’d made a mess \\nof it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea struck me: why \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6471\\uf64b\\nshould we trouble? Of course if you were in any danger or \\nanything, but why need you care? You needn’t care a hang \\nfor them. We shall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if \\nI were in your place I’d mystify them more than ever. How \\nashamed they’ll be afterwards! Hang them! We can thrash \\nthem afterwards, but let’s laugh at them now!’\\n‘To be sure,’ answered Raskolnikov. ‘But what will you \\nsay to-morrow?’ he thought to himself.',\n",
              " 'Strange to say, till \\nthat moment it had never occurred to him to wonder what \\nRazumihin would think when he knew. As he thought it, \\nRaskolnikov looked at him. Razumihin’s account of his vis-\\nit to Porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had \\ncome and gone since then.\\nIn the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived \\npunctually at eight, and was looking for the number, so \\nthat all three went in together without greeting or look-\\ning at one another. The young men walked in first, while \\nPyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a little in the \\npassage, taking off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna came \\nforward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was \\nwelcoming her brother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and \\nquite amiably, though with redoubled dignity, bowed to the \\nladies. He looked, however, as though he were a little put \\nout and could not yet recover himself. Pulcheria Alexan-\\ndrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to \\nmake them all sit down at the round table where a samovar \\nwas boiling. Dounia and Luzhin were facing one another \\non opposite sides of the table. Razumihin and Raskolnikov \\nwere facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihin was next \\n\\uf6471\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nto Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister.\\nA moment’s silence followed. Pyotr Petrovitch delib-\\nerately drew out a cambric handkerchief reeking of scent \\nand blew his nose with an air of a benevolent man who felt \\nhimself slighted, and was firmly resolved to insist on an ex-\\nplanation. In the passage the idea had occurred to him to \\nkeep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two \\nladies a sharp and emphatic lesson and make them feel the \\ngravity of the position. But he could not bring himself to \\ndo this. Besides, he could not endure uncertainty, and he \\nwanted an explanation: if his request had been so openly \\ndisobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case \\nit was better to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to \\npunish them and there would always be time for that.\\n‘I trust you had a favourable journey,’ he inquired offi-\\ncially of Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n‘Oh, very, Pyotr Petrovitch.’\\n‘I am gratified to hear it. And Avdotya Romanovna is not \\nover-fatigued either?’\\n‘I am young and strong, I don’t get tired, but it was a great \\nstrain for mother,’ answered Dounia.\\n‘That’s unavoidable! our national railways are of terrible \\nlength. ‘Mother Russia,’ as they say, is a vast country…. In \\nspite of all my desire to do so, I was unable to meet you yes-\\nterday. But I trust all passed off without inconvenience?’\\n‘Oh, no, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was all terribly disheart-\\nening,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna hastened to declare with \\npeculiar intonation, ‘and if Dmitri Prokofitch had not been \\nsent us, I really believe by God Himself, we should have \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf6450\\nbeen utterly lost. Here, he is! Dmitri Prokofitch Razumihin,’ \\nshe added, introducing him to Luzhin.\\n‘I had the pleasure … yesterday,’ muttered Pyotr Petro-\\nvitch with a hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he \\nscowled and was silent.\\nPyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on \\nthe surface very polite in society, who make a great point of \\npunctiliousness, but who, directly they are crossed in any-\\nthing, are completely disconcerted, and become more like \\nsacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society. Again \\nall was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya \\nRomanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too \\nsoon. Razumihin had nothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexan-\\ndrovna was anxious again.\\n‘Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?’ she began hav-\\ning recourse to her leading item of conversation.\\n‘To be sure, I heard so. I was immediately informed, \\nand I have come to make you acquainted with the fact that \\nArkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov set off in haste for Peters-\\nburg immediately after his wife’s funeral. So at least I have \\nexcellent authority for believing.’\\n‘To Petersburg? here?’ Dounia asked in alarm and looked \\nat her mother.\\n‘Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, \\nhaving in view the rapidity of his departure, and all the cir-\\ncumstances preceding it.’\\n‘Good heavens! won’t he leave Dounia in peace even \\nhere?’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n‘I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna \\n\\uf647\\uf6451\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nhave any grounds for uneasiness, unless, of course, you are \\nyourselves desirous of getting into communication with \\nhim. For my part I am on my guard, and am now discover-\\ning where he is lodging.',\n",
              " '’\\n‘Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright \\nyou have given me,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: ‘I’ve \\nonly seen him twice, but I thought him terrible, terrible! \\nI am convinced that he was the cause of Marfa Petrovna’s \\ndeath.’\\n‘It’s impossible to be certain about that. I have precise \\ninformation. I do not dispute that he may have contribut-\\ned to accelerate the course of events by the moral influence, \\nso to say, of the affront; but as to the general conduct and \\nmoral characteristics of that personage, I am in agreement \\nwith you. I do not know whether he is well off now, and pre-\\ncisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to \\nme within a very short period; but no doubt here in Peters-\\nburg, if he has any pecuniary resources, he will relapse at \\nonce into his old ways. He is the most depraved, and abject-\\nly vicious specimen of that class of men. I have considerable \\nreason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so unfor-\\ntunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight \\nyears ago, was of service to him also in another way. Solely \\nby her exertions and sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving \\nan element of fantastic and homicidal brutality for which \\nhe might well have been sentenced to Siberia, was hushed \\nup. That’s the sort of man he is, if you care to know.’\\n‘Good heavens!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskol-\\nnikov listened attentively.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf645\\uf645\\n‘Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have \\ngood evidence of this?’ Dounia asked sternly and emphati-\\ncally.\\n‘I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. \\nI must observe that from the legal point of view the case was \\nfar from clear. There was, and I believe still is, living here \\na woman called Resslich, a foreigner, who lent small sums \\nof money at interest, and did other commissions, and with \\nthis woman Svidrigaïlov had for a long while close and mys-\\nterious relations. She had a relation, a niece I believe, living \\nwith her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not \\nmore than fourteen. Resslich hated this girl, and grudged \\nher every crust; she used to beat her mercilessly. One day \\nthe girl was found hanging in the garret. At the inquest the \\nverdict was suicide. After the usual proceedings the matter \\nended, but, later on, information was given that the child \\nhad been … cruelly outraged by Svidrigaïlov. It is true, this \\nwas not clearly established, the information was given by \\nanother German woman of loose character whose word \\ncould not be trusted; no statement was actually made to the \\npolice, thanks to Marfa Petrovna’s money and exertions; it \\ndid not get beyond gossip. And yet the story is a very signifi-\\ncant one. You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when \\nyou were with them the story of the servant Philip who died \\nof ill treatment he received six years ago, before the aboli-\\ntion of serfdom.’\\n‘I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged him-\\nself.’\\n‘Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps dis-\\n\\uf647\\uf645\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nposed him, to suicide was the systematic persecution and \\nseverity of Mr. Svidrigaïlov.’\\n‘I don’t know that,’ answered Dounia, dryly. ‘I only heard \\na queer story that Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort \\nof domestic philosopher, the servants used to say, ‘he read \\nhimself silly,’ and that he hanged himself partly on account \\nof Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s mockery of him and not his blows. \\nWhen I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they \\nwere actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame \\nhim for Philip’s death.’\\n‘I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed \\nto undertake his defence all of a sudden,’ Luzhin observed, \\ntwisting his lips into an ambiguous smile, ‘there’s no doubt \\nthat he is an astute man, and insinuating where ladies are \\nconcerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has died so \\nstrangely, is a terrible instance. My only desire has been to \\nbe of service to you and your mother with my advice, in \\nview of the renewed efforts which may certainly be antici-\\npated from him. For my part it’s my firm conviction, that he \\nwill end in a debtor’s prison again. Marfa Petrovna had not \\nthe slightest intention of settling anything substantial on \\nhim, having regard for his children’s interests, and, if she \\nleft him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency, \\nsomething insignificant and ephemeral, which would not \\nlast a year for a man of his habits.’\\n‘Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you,’ said Dounia, ‘say no more of \\nMr. Svidrigaïlov.

He is particularly anxious, by the way, \\nDounia, for an interview with you, at which he asked me to \\nassist. He has a proposition to make to you, and he told me \\nabout it. He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa \\nPetrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dou-\\nnia, and that you can receive the money very shortly.’\\n‘Thank God!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing \\nherself. ‘Pray for her soul, Dounia!’\\n‘It’s a fact!’ broke from Luzhin.\\n‘Tell us, what more?’ Dounia urged Raskolnikov.\\n‘Then he said that he wasn’t rich and all the estate was \\nleft to his children who are now with an aunt, then that he \\nwas staying somewhere not far from me, but where, I don’t \\nknow, I didn’t ask….’\\n‘But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?’ \\ncried Pulcheria Alexandrovna in a fright. ‘Did he tell you?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘What was it?’\\n‘I’ll tell you afterwards.’\\nRaskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention \\nto his tea.\\nPyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch.\\n‘I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I \\nshall not be in your way,’ he added with an air of some pique \\n\\uf647\\uf645\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nand he began getting up.\\n‘Don’t go, Pyotr Petrovitch,’ said Dounia, ‘you intended \\nto spend the evening. Besides, you wrote yourself that you \\nwanted to have an explanation with mother.’\\n‘Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna,’ Pyotr Petrovitch an-\\nswered impressively, sitting down again, but still holding \\nhis hat. ‘I certainly desired an explanation with you and \\nyour honoured mother upon a very important point indeed. \\nBut as your brother cannot speak openly in my presence of \\nsome proposals of Mr. Svidrigaïlov, I, too, do not desire and \\nam not able to speak openly … in the presence of others \\n… of certain matters of the greatest gravity. Moreover, my \\nmost weighty and urgent request has been disregarded….’\\nAssuming an aggrieved air, Luzhin relapsed into digni-\\nfied silence.\\n‘Your request that my brother should not be present at our \\nmeeting was disregarded solely at my instance,’ said Dou-\\nnia. ‘You wrote that you had been insulted by my brother; I \\nthink that this must be explained at once, and you must be \\nreconciled. And if Rodya really has insulted you, then he \\nshould and will apologise.’\\nPyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line.\\n‘There are insults, Avdotya Romanovna, which no good-\\nwill can make us forget. There is a line in everything which \\nit is dangerous to overstep; and when it has been over-\\nstepped, there is no return.’\\n‘That wasn’t what I was speaking of exactly, Pyotr Petro-\\nvitch,’ Dounia interrupted with some impatience. ‘Please \\nunderstand that our whole future depends now on wheth-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf645\\uf649\\ner all this is explained and set right as soon as possible. I \\ntell you frankly at the start that I cannot look at it in any \\nother light, and if you have the least regard for me, all this \\nbusiness must be ended to-day, however hard that may be. \\nI repeat that if my brother is to blame he will ask your for-\\ngiveness.’\\n‘I am surprised at your putting the question like that,’ \\nsaid Luzhin, getting more and more irritated. ‘Esteeming, \\nand so to say, adoring you, I may at the same time, very \\nwell indeed, be able to dislike some member of your family. \\nThough I lay claim to the happiness of your hand, I cannot \\naccept duties incompatible with …’\\n‘Ah, don’t be so ready to take offence, Pyotr Petrovitch,’ \\nDounia interrupted with feeling, ‘and be the sensible and \\ngenerous man I have always considered, and wish to con-\\nsider, you to be.

When \\nI insisted on his coming to our interview to-day after your \\nletter, I told him nothing of what I meant to do. Understand \\nthat, if you are not reconciled, I must choose between you—\\nit must be either you or he. That is how the question rests \\non your side and on his. I don’t want to be mistaken in my \\nchoice, and I must not be. For your sake I must break off \\nwith my brother, for my brother’s sake I must break off with \\nyou.

Your son intentionally exaggerated the signifi-\\ncance of my words and made them ridiculous, accusing \\nme of malicious intentions, and, as far as I could see, relied \\nupon your correspondence with him.

You wrote this to \\nmake dissension between me and my family, and for that \\nobject added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl \\nwhom you don’t know. All that is mean slander.’\\n‘Excuse me, sir,’ said Luzhin, quivering with fury. ‘I en-\\nlarged upon your qualities and conduct in my letter solely \\nin response to your sister’s and mother’s inquiries, how I \\nfound you, and what impression you made on me.

Him, and him \\nalone, he blamed for everything. It is noteworthy that as he \\nwent downstairs he still imagined that his case was perhaps \\nnot utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were concerned, \\nall might ‘very well indeed’ be set right again.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf646\\uf647\\nChapter III\\nT\\nhe fact was that up to the last moment he had never ex-\\npected such an ending; he had been overbearing to the \\nlast degree, never dreaming that two destitute and defence-\\nless women could escape from his control. This conviction \\nwas strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit to the \\npoint of fatuity. Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up \\nfrom insignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, \\nhad the highest opinion of his intelligence and capacities, \\nand sometimes even gloated in solitude over his image in \\nthe glass. But what he loved and valued above all was the \\nmoney he had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts of de-\\nvices: that money made him the equal of all who had been \\nhis superiors.\\nWhen he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had de-\\ncided to take her in spite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had \\nspoken with perfect sincerity and had, indeed, felt genuine-\\nly indignant at such ‘black ingratitude.’ And yet, when he \\nmade Dounia his offer, he was fully aware of the ground-\\nlessness of all the gossip. The story had been everywhere \\ncontradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbe-\\nlieved by all the townspeople, who were warm in Dounia’a \\ndefence. And he would not have denied that he knew all that \\nat the time. Yet he still thought highly of his own resolution \\nin lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it as something \\n\\uf647\\uf646\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nheroic. In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secret \\nfeeling he cherished and admired, and he could not under-\\nstand that others should fail to admire it too. He had called \\non Raskolnikov with the feelings of a benefactor who is \\nabout to reap the fruits of his good deeds and to hear agree-\\nable flattery. And as he went downstairs now, he considered \\nhimself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised.\\nDounia was simply essential to him; to do without her \\nwas unthinkable. For many years he had had voluptuous \\ndreams of marriage, but he had gone on waiting and amass-\\ning money. He brooded with relish, in profound secret, over \\nthe image of a girl—virtuous, poor (she must be poor), very \\nyoung, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, \\none who had suffered much, and was completely humbled \\nbefore him, one who would all her life look on him as her \\nsaviour, worship him, admire him and only him. How \\nmany scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imag-\\nined on this seductive and playful theme, when his work \\nwas over! And, behold, the dream of so many years was \\nall but realised; the beauty and education of Avdotya Ro-\\nmanovna had impressed him; her helpless position had been \\na great allurement; in her he had found even more than he \\ndreamed of. Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of \\neducation and breeding superior to his own (he felt that), \\nand this creature would be slavishly grateful all her life for \\nhis heroic condescension, and would humble herself in the \\ndust before him, and he would have absolute, unbounded \\npower over her! … Not long before, he had, too, after long \\nreflection and hesitation, made an important change in his \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf646\\uf649\\ncareer and was now entering on a wider circle of business. \\nWith this change his cherished dreams of rising into a high-\\ner class of society seemed likely to be realised…. He was, in \\nfact, determined to try his fortune in Petersburg. He knew \\nthat women could do a very great deal. The fascination of a \\ncharming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make \\nhis way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to \\nhim, throwing an aureole round him, and now everything \\nwas in ruins! This sudden horrible rupture affected him like \\na clap of thunder; it was like a hideous joke, an absurdity. \\nHe had only been a tiny bit masterful, had not even time \\nto speak out, had simply made a joke, been carried away \\n—and it had ended so seriously. And, of course, too, he did \\nlove Dounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his \\ndreams—and all at once! No! The next day, the very next \\nday, it must all be set right, smoothed over, settled. Above \\nall he must crush that conceited milksop who was the cause \\nof it all. With a sick feeling he could not help recalling Ra-\\nzumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score; \\nas though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him! \\nThe man he really dreaded in earnest was Svidrigaïlov…. He \\nhad, in short, a great deal to attend to….\\n*****\\n‘No, I, I am more to blame than anyone!’ said Dounia, \\nkissing and embracing her mother. ‘I was tempted by his \\nmoney, but on my honour, brother, I had no idea he was \\nsuch a base man. If I had seen through him before, nothing \\nwould have tempted me! Don’t blame me, brother!’\\n‘God has delivered us!

Only now and then Dounia turned white and \\nfrowned, remembering what had passed. Pulcheria Alexan-\\ndrovna was surprised to find that she, too, was glad: she had \\nonly that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible \\nmisfortune. Razumihin was delighted. He did not yet dare \\nto express his joy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as \\nthough a ton-weight had fallen off his heart. Now he had the \\nright to devote his life to them, to serve them…. Anything \\nmight happen now! But he felt afraid to think of further \\npossibilities and dared not let his imagination range. But \\nRaskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and \\nindifferent. Though he had been the most insistent on get-\\nting rid of Luzhin, he seemed now the least concerned at \\nwhat had happened. Dounia could not help thinking that \\nhe was still angry with her, and Pulcheria Alexandrovna \\nwatched him timidly.\\n‘What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?’ said Dounia, ap-\\nproaching him.\\n‘Yes, yes!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\nRaskolnikov raised his head.\\n‘He wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles \\nand he desires to see you once in my presence.’\\n‘See her! On no account!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. \\n‘And how dare he offer her money!’\\nThen Raskolnikov repeated (rather dryly) his conversa-\\ntion with Svidrigaïlov, omitting his account of the ghostly \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf646\\uf64b\\nvisitations of Marfa Petrovna, wishing to avoid all unneces-\\nsary talk.\\n‘What answer did you give him?’ asked Dounia.\\n‘At first I said I would not take any message to you. Then \\nhe said that he would do his utmost to obtain an interview \\nwith you without my help. He assured me that his passion \\nfor you was a passing infatuation, now he has no feeling for \\nyou. He doesn’t want you to marry Luzhin…. His talk was \\naltogether rather muddled.’\\n‘How do you explain him to yourself, Rodya? How did \\nhe strike you?’\\n‘I must confess I don’t quite understand him. He offers \\nyou ten thousand, and yet says he is not well off. He says \\nhe is going away, and in ten minutes he forgets he has said \\nit. Then he says is he going to be married and has already \\nfixed on the girl…. No doubt he has a motive, and probably \\na bad one. But it’s odd that he should be so clumsy about it if \\nhe had any designs against you…. Of course, I refused this \\nmoney on your account, once for all. Altogether, I thought \\nhim very strange…. One might almost think he was mad. \\nBut I may be mistaken; that may only be the part he as-\\nsumes. The death of Marfa Petrovna seems to have made a \\ngreat impression on him.’\\n‘God rest her soul,’ exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna. \\n‘I shall always, always pray for her! Where should we be \\nnow, Dounia, without this three thousand! It’s as though it \\nhad fallen from heaven! Why, Rodya, this morning we had \\nonly three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and I were just \\nplanning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from \\n\\uf647\\uf646\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthat man until he offered help.’\\nDounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidrigaïlov’s of-\\nfer. She still stood meditating.\\n‘He has got some terrible plan,’ she said in a half whisper \\nto herself, almost shuddering.',\n",
              " 'Raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.\\n‘I fancy I shall have to see him more than once again,’ he \\nsaid to Dounia.\\n‘We will watch him! I will track him out!’ cried Razumi-\\nhin, vigorously. ‘I won’t lose sight of him. Rodya has given \\nme leave. He said to me himself just now. ‘Take care of my \\nsister.’ Will you give me leave, too, Avdotya Romanovna?’\\nDounia smiled and held out her hand, but the look of \\nanxiety did not leave her face. Pulcheria Alexandrovna \\ngazed at her timidly, but the three thousand roubles had \\nobviously a soothing effect on her.\\nA quarter of an hour later, they were all engaged in a \\nlively conversation. Even Raskolnikov listened attentively \\nfor some time, though he did not talk. Razumihin was the \\nspeaker.\\n‘And why, why should you go away?’ he flowed on ecstati-\\ncally. ‘And what are you to do in a little town? The great \\nthing is, you are all here together and you need one an-\\nother—you do need one another, believe me. For a time, \\nanyway…. Take me into partnership, and I assure you we’ll \\nplan a capital enterprise. Listen! I’ll explain it all in detail \\nto you, the whole project! It all flashed into my head this \\nmorning, before anything had happened … I tell you what; \\nI have an uncle, I must introduce him to you (a most ac-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf6470\\ncommodating and respectable old man). This uncle has got \\na capital of a thousand roubles, and he lives on his pension \\nand has no need of that money. For the last two years he has \\nbeen bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six \\nper cent. interest. I know what that means; he simply wants \\nto help me. Last year I had no need of it, but this year I re-\\nsolved to borrow it as soon as he arrived. Then you lend me \\nanother thousand of your three and we have enough for a \\nstart, so we’ll go into partnership, and what are we going \\nto do?’\\nThen Razumihin began to unfold his project, and he \\nexplained at length that almost all our publishers and book-\\nsellers know nothing at all of what they are selling, and for \\nthat reason they are usually bad publishers, and that any \\ndecent publications pay as a rule and give a profit, some-\\ntimes a considerable one. Razumihin had, indeed, been \\ndreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last two years \\nhe had been working in publishers’ offices, and knew three \\nEuropean languages well, though he had told Raskolnikov \\nsix days before that he was ‘schwach’ in German with an \\nobject of persuading him to take half his translation and \\nhalf the payment for it. He had told a lie then, and Raskol-\\nnikov knew he was lying.\\n‘Why, why should we let our chance slip when we have \\none of the chief means of success—money of our own!’ cried \\nRazumihin warmly. ‘Of course there will be a lot of work, \\nbut we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna, I, Rodion…. \\nYou get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! And the \\ngreat point of the business is that we shall know just what \\n\\uf647\\uf6471\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nwants translating, and we shall be translating, publishing, \\nlearning all at once. I can be of use because I have experi-\\nence. For nearly two years I’ve been scuttling about among \\nthe publishers, and now I know every detail of their busi-\\nness. You need not be a saint to make pots, believe me! And \\nwhy, why should we let our chance slip! Why, I know—and \\nI kept the secret—two or three books which one might get \\na hundred roubles simply for thinking of translating and \\npublishing. Indeed, and I would not take five hundred for \\nthe very idea of one of them. And what do you think? If I \\nwere to tell a publisher, I dare say he’d hesitate—they are \\nsuch blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, pa-\\nper, selling, you trust to me, I know my way about. We’ll \\nbegin in a small way and go on to a large. In any case it will \\nget us our living and we shall get back our capital.’\\nDounia’s eyes shone.\\n‘I like what you are saying, Dmitri Prokofitch!’ she said.\\n‘I know nothing about it, of course,’ put in Pulcheria Al-\\nexandrovna, ‘it may be a good idea, but again God knows.',\n",
              " 'It’s new and untried. Of course, we must remain here at \\nleast for a time.’ She looked at Rodya.\\n‘What do you think, brother?’ said Dounia.\\n‘I think he’s got a very good idea,’ he answered. ‘Of \\ncourse, it’s too soon to dream of a publishing firm, but we \\ncertainly might bring out five or six books and be sure of \\nsuccess. I know of one book myself which would be sure to \\ngo well. And as for his being able to manage it, there’s no \\ndoubt about that either. He knows the business…. But we \\ncan talk it over later….’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf647\\uf645\\n‘Hurrah!’ cried Razumihin. ‘Now, stay, there’s a flat here \\nin this house, belonging to the same owner.

It was what he was thinking, and it somehow \\nwas uttered aloud.\\n‘What is the matter with you?’ cried his mother.\\n‘Where are you going, Rodya?’ asked Dounia rather \\nstrangely.\\n‘Oh, I’m quite obliged to …’ he answered vaguely, as \\nthough hesitating what he would say. But there was a look \\nof sharp determination in his white face.\\n‘I meant to say … as I was coming here … I meant to \\ntell you, mother, and you, Dounia, that it would be better \\nfor us to part for a time.

For a minute they were looking at one another in \\nsilence. Razumihin remembered that minute all his life.

Something strange, as \\nit were, passed between them…. Some idea, some hint, as it \\nwere, slipped, something awful, hideous, and suddenly un-\\nderstood on both sides….

It was an old green house of three \\nstoreys. He found the porter and obtained from him vague \\ndirections as to the whereabouts of Kapernaumov, the tailor. \\nHaving found in the corner of the courtyard the entrance \\nto the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second \\nfloor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole \\nsecond storey over the yard. While he was wandering in the \\ndarkness, uncertain where to turn for Kapernaumov’s door, \\na door opened three paces from him; he mechanically took \\nhold of it.\\n‘Who is there?’ a woman’s voice asked uneasily.\\n‘It’s I … come to see you,’ answered Raskolnikov and he \\nwalked into the tiny entry.\\nOn a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper \\ncandlestick.\\n‘It’s you! Good heavens!’ cried Sonia weakly, and she \\nstood rooted to the spot.\\n‘Which is your room? This way?’ and Raskolnikov, trying \\nnot to look at her, hastened in.\\nA minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set \\ndown the candlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood \\nbefore him inexpressibly agitated and apparently fright-\\nened by his unexpected visit. The colour rushed suddenly \\n\\uf647\\uf647\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nto her pale face and tears came into her eyes … She felt sick \\nand ashamed and happy, too…. Raskolnikov turned away \\nquickly and sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the \\nroom in a rapid glance.\\nIt was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only \\none let by the Kapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door \\nled in the wall on the left. In the opposite side on the right \\nhand wall was another door, always kept locked. That led \\nto the next flat, which formed a separate lodging. Sonia’s \\nroom looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle \\nand this gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three \\nwindows looking out on to the canal ran aslant so that one \\ncorner formed a very acute angle, and it was difficult to see \\nin it without very strong light. The other corner was dis-\\nproportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any furniture \\nin the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead, \\nbeside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table cov-\\nered by a blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the \\ndoor into the other flat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by \\nthe table. On the opposite wall near the acute angle stood \\na small plain wooden chest of drawers looking, as it were, \\nlost in a desert. That was all there was in the room. The \\nyellow, scratched and shabby wall- paper was black in the \\ncorners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the \\nwinter. There was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead \\nhad no curtain.\\nSonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so atten-\\ntively and unceremoniously scrutinising her room, and \\neven began at last to tremble with terror, as though she was \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf647\\uf64b\\nstanding before her judge and the arbiter of her destinies.\\n‘I am late…. It’s eleven, isn’t it?’ he asked, still not lifting \\nhis eyes.\\n‘Yes,’ muttered Sonia, ‘oh yes, it is,’ she added, hastily, as \\nthough in that lay her means of escape. ‘My landlady’s clock \\nhas just struck … I heard it myself….’\\n‘I’ve come to you for the last time,’ Raskolnikov went on \\ngloomily, although this was the first time. ‘I may perhaps \\nnot see you again …’\\n‘Are you … going away?’\\n‘I don’t know … to-morrow….’\\n‘Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-mor-\\nrow?’ Sonia’s voice shook.\\n‘I don’t know. I shall know to-morrow morning….',\n",
              " 'Never \\nmind that: I’ve come to say one word….’\\nHe raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed \\nthat he was sitting down while she was all the while stand-\\ning before him.\\n‘Why are you standing? Sit down,’ he said in a changed \\nvoice, gentle and friendly.\\nShe sat down. He looked kindly and almost compassion-\\nately at her.\\n‘How thin you are! What a hand! Quite transparent, like \\na dead hand.’\\nHe took her hand. Sonia smiled faintly.\\n‘I have always been like that,’ she said.\\n‘Even when you lived at home?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘Of course, you were,’ he added abruptly and the expres-\\n\\uf647\\uf647\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nsion of his face and the sound of his voice changed again \\nsuddenly.\\nHe looked round him once more.\\n‘You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?’\\n‘Yes….’\\n‘They live there, through that door?’\\n‘Yes…. They have another room like this.’\\n‘All in one room?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘I should be afraid in your room at night,’ he observed \\ngloomily.\\n‘They are very good people, very kind,’ answered Sonia, \\nwho still seemed bewildered, ‘and all the furniture, every-\\nthing … everything is theirs. And they are very kind and \\nthe children, too, often come to see me.’\\n‘They all stammer, don’t they?’\\n‘Yes…. He stammers and he’s lame. And his wife, too…. \\nIt’s not exactly that she stammers, but she can’t speak plain-\\nly. She is a very kind woman. And he used to be a house serf. \\nAnd there are seven children … and it’s only the eldest one \\nthat stammers and the others are simply ill … but they don’t \\nstammer…. But where did you hear about them?’ she added \\nwith some surprise.\\n‘Your father told me, then. He told me all about you…. \\nAnd how you went out at six o’clock and came back at nine \\nand how Katerina Ivanovna knelt down by your bed.’\\nSonia was confused.\\n‘I fancied I saw him to-day,’ she whispered hesitatingly.\\n‘Whom?’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf6480\\n‘Father. I was walking in the street, out there at the cor-\\nner, about ten o’clock and he seemed to be walking in front. \\nIt looked just like him.

No!’ Sonia looked at him \\nalmost with dismay.\\n‘You love her, then?’\\n‘Love her? Of course!’ said Sonia with plaintive empha-\\nsis, and she clasped her hands in distress.',\n",

And how \\nclever she used to be … how generous … how kind! Ah, you \\ndon’t understand, you don’t understand!’\\nSonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands \\nin excitement and distress. Her pale cheeks flushed, there \\nwas a look of anguish in her eyes. It was clear that she was \\nstirred to the very depths, that she was longing to speak, \\nto champion, to express something. A sort of insatiable \\ncompassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in every \\nfeature of her face.\\n‘Beat me! how can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if \\nshe did beat me, what then? What of it? You know nothing, \\nnothing about it…. She is so unhappy … ah, how unhap-\\npy! And ill…. She is seeking righteousness, she is pure. She \\nhas such faith that there must be righteousness everywhere \\n\\uf647\\uf6481\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nand she expects it…. And if you were to torture her, she \\nwouldn’t do wrong.

They are in debt for the lodging, but the \\nlandlady, I hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of \\nthem, and Katerina Ivanovna says that she won’t stay an-\\nother minute.’\\n‘How is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?’\\n‘Oh, no, don’t talk like that…. We are one, we live like \\none.’ Sonia was agitated again and even angry, as though \\na canary or some other little bird were to be angry. ‘And \\nwhat could she do? What, what could she do?’ she persist-\\ned, getting hot and excited. ‘And how she cried to-day! Her \\nmind is unhinged, haven’t you noticed it? At one minute \\nshe is worrying like a child that everything should be right \\nto-morrow, the lunch and all that…. Then she is wringing \\nher hands, spitting blood, weeping, and all at once she will \\nbegin knocking her head against the wall, in despair. Then \\nshe will be comforted again. She builds all her hopes on \\nyou; she says that you will help her now and that she will \\nborrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf648\\uf645\\nwith me and set up a boarding school for the daughters of \\ngentlemen and take me to superintend it, and we will begin \\na new splendid life. And she kisses and hugs me, comforts \\nme, and you know she has such faith, such faith in her fan-\\ncies! One can’t contradict her. And all the day long she has \\nbeen washing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash \\ntub into the room with her feeble hands and sank on the \\nbed, gasping for breath. We went this morning to the shops \\nto buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are quite worn \\nout. Only the money we’d reckoned wasn’t enough, not \\nnearly enough.

I went to see them,’ she went on, weeping, ‘and \\nfather said, ‘read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read \\nto me, here’s a book.’ He had a book he had got from Andrey \\n\\uf647\\uf648\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nSemyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives there, he always used \\nto get hold of such funny books. And I said, ‘I can’t stay,’ as \\nI didn’t want to read, and I’d gone in chiefly to show Kat-\\nerina Ivanovna some collars.

He put his two hands on her shoulders \\nand looked straight into her tearful face. His eyes were hard, \\nfeverish and piercing, his lips were twitching. All at once he \\nbent down quickly and dropping to the ground, kissed her \\nfoot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. And \\ncertainly he looked like a madman.\\n‘What are you doing to me?’ she muttered, turning pale, \\nand a sudden anguish clutched at her heart.\\nHe stood up at once.\\n‘I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suf-\\nfering of humanity,’ he said wildly and walked away to the \\nwindow. ‘Listen,’ he added, turning to her a minute later. ‘I \\nsaid just now to an insolent man that he was not worth your \\nlittle finger … and that I did my sister honour making her \\nsit beside you.’\\n‘Ach, you said that to them! And in her presence?’ cried \\nSonia, frightened. ‘Sit down with me! An honour! Why, I’m \\n… dishonourable…. Ah, why did you say that?’\\n‘It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said \\nthat of you, but because of your great suffering. But you are \\na great sinner, that’s true,’ he added almost solemnly, ‘and \\nyour worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed your-\\nself for nothing. Isn’t that fearful?

It would be better, a thousand \\ntimes better and wiser to leap into the water and end it all!’\\n‘But what would become of them?’ Sonia asked faintly, \\ngazing at him with eyes of anguish, but not seeming sur-\\nprised at his suggestion.\\nRaskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her \\nface; so she must have had that thought already, perhaps \\nmany times, and earnestly she had thought out in her de-\\nspair how to end it and so earnestly, that now she scarcely \\nwondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed the \\ncruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and \\nhis peculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not \\nnoticed either, and that, too, was clear to him.',\n",
              " ') But he saw \\nhow monstrously the thought of her disgraceful, shame-\\nful position was torturing her and had long tortured her. \\n‘What, what,’ he thought, ‘could hitherto have hindered her \\nfrom putting an end to it?’ Only then he realised what those \\npoor little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Kat-\\nerina Ivanovna, knocking her head against the wall in her \\nconsumption, meant for Sonia.\\nBut, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her \\ncharacter and the amount of education she had after all re-\\nceived, she could not in any case remain so. He was still \\nconfronted by the question, how could she have remained \\nso long in that position without going out of her mind, \\nsince she could not bring herself to jump into the water? \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf648\\uf64b\\nOf course he knew that Sonia’s position was an exception-\\nal case, though unhappily not unique and not infrequent, \\nindeed; but that very exceptionalness, her tinge of educa-\\ntion, her previous life might, one would have thought, have \\nkilled her at the first step on that revolting path. What held \\nher up—surely not depravity? All that infamy had obvi-\\nously only touched her mechanically, not one drop of real \\ndepravity had penetrated to her heart; he saw that. He saw \\nthrough her as she stood before him….\\n‘There are three ways before her,’ he thought, ‘the canal, \\nthe madhouse, or … at last to sink into depravity which ob-\\nscures the mind and turns the heart to stone.’\\nThe last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, \\nhe was young, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could \\nnot help believing that the last end was the most likely.\\n‘But can that be true?’ he cried to himself. ‘Can that \\ncreature who has still preserved the purity of her spirit be \\nconsciously drawn at last into that sink of filth and iniquity? \\nCan the process already have begun? Can it be that she has \\nonly been able to bear it till now, because vice has begun to \\nbe less loathsome to her? No, no, that cannot be!’ he cried, \\nas Sonia had just before. ‘No, what has kept her from the ca-\\nnal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children…. And \\nif she has not gone out of her mind … but who says she has \\nnot gone out of her mind? Is she in her senses? Can one talk, \\ncan one reason as she does? How can she sit on the edge of \\nthe abyss of loathsomeness into which she is slipping and \\nrefuse to listen when she is told of danger? Does she expect \\na miracle? No doubt she does. Doesn’t that all mean mad-\\n\\uf647\\uf648\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nness?’\\nHe stayed obstinately at that thought. He liked that ex-\\nplanation indeed better than any other. He began looking \\nmore intently at her.\\n‘So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia?’ he asked her.\\nSonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an \\nanswer.\\n‘What should I be without God?’ she whispered rapidly, \\nforcibly, glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes, and \\nsqueezing his hand.\\n‘Ah, so that is it!’ he thought.\\n‘And what does God do for you?’ he asked, probing her \\nfurther.\\nSonia was silent a long while, as though she could not \\nanswer. Her weak chest kept heaving with emotion.\\n‘Be silent! Don’t ask! You don’t deserve!’ she cried sud-\\ndenly, looking sternly and wrathfully at him.\\n‘That’s it, that’s it,’ he repeated to himself.\\n‘He does everything,’ she whispered quickly, looking \\ndown again.\\n‘That’s the way out! That’s the explanation,’ he decided, \\nscrutinising her with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, \\nalmost morbid feeling. He gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, \\nangular little face, those soft blue eyes, which could flash \\nwith such fire, such stern energy, that little body still shak-\\ning with indignation and anger—and it all seemed to him \\nmore and more strange, almost impossible. ‘She is a reli-\\ngious maniac!’ he repeated to himself.\\nThere was a book lying on the chest of drawers. He had \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf6490\\nnoticed it every time he paced up and down the room. Now \\nhe took it up and looked at it. It was the New Testament \\nin the Russian translation.

It’s in the fourth \\ngospel,’ she whispered sternly, without looking at him.\\n‘Find it and read it to me,’ he said. He sat down with his \\nelbow on the table, leaned his head on his hand and looked \\naway sullenly, prepared to listen.\\n‘In three weeks’ time they’ll welcome me in the mad-\\nhouse!

It’s infectious!’\\n‘Read!’ he cried irritably and insistently.\\nSonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hard-\\nly dared to read to him. He looked almost with exasperation \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf649\\uf645\\nat the ‘unhappy lunatic.’\\n‘What for? You don’t believe? …’ she whispered softly \\nand as it were breathlessly.',\n",
              " '‘Read! I want you to,’ he persisted. ‘You used to read to \\nLizaveta.’\\nSonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands \\nwere shaking, her voice failed her. Twice she tried to begin \\nand could not bring out the first syllable.\\n‘Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany \\n…’ she forced herself at last to read, but at the third word her \\nvoice broke like an overstrained string. There was a catch \\nin her breath.\\nRaskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring \\nherself to read to him and the more he saw this, the more \\nroughly and irritably he insisted on her doing so. He un-\\nderstood only too well how painful it was for her to betray \\nand unveil all that was her own. He understood that these \\nfeelings really were her secret treasure which she had kept \\nperhaps for years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived \\nwith an unhappy father and a distracted stepmother crazed \\nby grief, in the midst of starving children and unseemly \\nabuse and reproaches. But at the same time he knew now \\nand knew for certain that, although it filled her with dread \\nand suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to \\nread to him that he might hear it, and to read now whatever \\nmight come of it! … He read this in her eyes, he could see it \\nin her intense emotion. She mastered herself, controlled the \\nspasm in her throat and went on reading the eleventh chap-\\nter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenth verse:\\n\\uf647\\uf649\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to com-\\nfort them concerning their brother.\\n‘Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming \\nwent and met Him: but Mary sat still in the house.\\n‘Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been \\nhere, my brother had not died.\\n‘But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of \\nGod, God will give it Thee….’\\nThen she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that \\nher voice would quiver and break again.\\n‘Jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again.\\n‘Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again \\nin the resurrection, at the last day.\\n‘Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he \\nthat believeth in Me though he were dead, yet shall he live.\\n‘And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never \\ndie. Believest thou this?\\n‘She saith unto Him,’\\n(And drawing a painful breath, Sonia read distinctly and \\nforcibly as though she were making a public confession of \\nfaith.)\\n‘Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of \\nGod Which should come into the world.’\\nShe stopped and looked up quickly at him, but con-\\ntrolling herself went on reading. Raskolnikov sat without \\nmoving, his elbows on the table and his eyes turned away. \\nShe read to the thirty-second verse.\\n‘Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw \\nHim, she fell down at His feet, saying unto Him, Lord if \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf649\\uf647\\nThou hadst been here, my brother had not died.\\n‘When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also \\nweeping which came with her, He groaned in the spirit and \\nwas troubled,\\n‘And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto Him, \\nLord, come and see.\\n‘Jesus wept.\\n‘Then said the Jews, behold how He loved him!\\n‘And some of them said, could not this Man which opened \\nthe eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should \\nnot have died?’\\nRaskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion. \\nYes, he had known it! She was trembling in a real physi-\\ncal fever. He had expected it. She was getting near the story \\nof the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense triumph \\ncame over her. Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and \\njoy gave it power. The lines danced before her eyes, but she \\nknew what she was reading by heart. At the last verse ‘Could \\nnot this Man which opened the eyes of the blind …’ drop-\\nping her voice she passionately reproduced the doubt, the \\nreproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews, who \\nin another moment would fall at His feet as though struck \\nby thunder, sobbing and believing…. ‘And he, he—too, is \\nblinded and unbelieving, he, too, will hear, he, too, will be-\\nlieve, yes, yes! At once, now,’ was what she was dreaming, \\nand she was quivering with happy anticipation.\\n‘Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the \\ngrave.',\n",
              " 'It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.\\n‘Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of \\n\\uf647\\uf649\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nhim that was dead, saith unto Him, Lord by this time he \\nstinketh: for he hath been dead four days.’\\nShe laid emphasis on the word four.\\n‘Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if thou \\nwouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?\\n‘Then they took away the stone from the place where the \\ndead was laid. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, \\nI thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me.\\n‘And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because \\nof the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe \\nthat Thou hast sent Me.\\n‘And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud \\nvoice, Lazarus, come forth.\\n‘And he that was dead came forth.’\\n(She read loudly, cold and trembling with ecstasy, as \\nthough she were seeing it before her eyes.)\\n‘Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was \\nbound about with a napkin.

She still trembled \\nfeverishly. The candle-end was flickering out in the battered \\ncandlestick, dimly lighting up in the poverty-stricken room \\nthe murderer and the harlot who had so strangely been read-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf649\\uf649\\ning together the eternal book. Five minutes or more passed.\\n‘I came to speak of something,’ Raskolnikov said aloud, \\nfrowning. He got up and went to Sonia. She lifted her eyes \\nto him in silence. His face was particularly stern and there \\nwas a sort of savage determination in it.\\n‘I have abandoned my family to-day,’ he said, ‘my moth-\\ner and sister. I am not going to see them. I’ve broken with \\nthem completely.’\\n‘What for?’ asked Sonia amazed. Her recent meeting with \\nhis mother and sister had left a great impression which she \\ncould not analyse. She heard his news almost with horror.\\n‘I have only you now,’ he added. ‘Let us go together…. I’ve \\ncome to you, we are both accursed, let us go our way to-\\ngether!’\\nHis eyes glittered ‘as though he were mad,’ Sonia thought, \\nin her turn.\\n‘Go where?’ she asked in alarm and she involuntarily \\nstepped back.\\n‘How do I know? I only know it’s the same road, I know \\nthat and nothing more. It’s the same goal!’\\nShe looked at him and understood nothing. She knew \\nonly that he was terribly, infinitely unhappy.\\n‘No one of them will understand, if you tell them, but \\nI have understood. I need you, that is why I have come to \\nyou.’\\n‘I don’t understand,’ whispered Sonia.\\n‘You’ll understand later.',\n",
              " 'Haven’t you done the same? You, \\ntoo, have transgressed … have had the strength to trans-\\ngress.

She \\njumped up from time to time, wept and wrung her hands, \\nthen sank again into feverish sleep and dreamt of Polenka, \\nKaterina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of reading the gospel and \\nhim … him with pale face, with burning eyes … kissing her \\n\\uf647\\uf649\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nfeet, weeping.\\nOn the other side of the door on the right, which divid-\\ned Sonia’s room from Madame Resslich’s flat, was a room \\nwhich had long stood empty.

              " 'But all that time Mr. Svidrigaïlov had \\nbeen standing, listening at the door of the empty room. \\nWhen Raskolnikov went out he stood still, thought a mo-\\nment, went on tiptoe to his own room which adjoined the \\nempty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it to the \\ndoor that led to Sonia’s room. The conversation had struck \\nhim as interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly en-\\njoyed it—so much so that he brought a chair that he might \\nnot in the future, to-morrow, for instance, have to endure \\nthe inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but might lis-\\nten in comfort.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf64a0\\nChapter V\\nW\\nhen next morning at eleven o’clock punctually Raskol-\\nnikov went into the department of the investigation \\nof criminal causes and sent his name in to Porfiry Petro-\\nvitch, he was surprised at being kept waiting so long: it was \\nat least ten minutes before he was summoned. He had ex-\\npected that they would pounce upon him. But he stood in \\nthe waiting- room, and people, who apparently had nothing \\nto do with him, were continually passing to and fro before \\nhim. In the next room which looked like an office, several \\nclerks were sitting writing and obviously they had no no-\\ntion who or what Raskolnikov might be. He looked uneasily \\nand suspiciously about him to see whether there was not \\nsome guard, some mysterious watch being kept on him to \\nprevent his escape. But there was nothing of the sort: he \\nsaw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty details, then \\nother people, no one seemed to have any concern with him. \\nHe might go where he liked for them. The conviction grew \\nstronger in him that if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that \\nphantom sprung out of the earth, had seen everything, they \\nwould not have let him stand and wait like that. And would \\nthey have waited till he elected to appear at eleven? Either \\nthe man had not yet given information, or … or simply he \\nknew nothing, had seen nothing (and how could he have \\nseen anything?) and so all that had happened to him the \\n\\uf647\\uf64a1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nday before was again a phantom exaggerated by his sick and \\noverstrained imagination. This conjecture had begun to \\ngrow strong the day before, in the midst of all his alarm and \\ndespair. Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh \\nconflict, he was suddenly aware that he was trembling—\\nand he felt a rush of indignation at the thought that he was \\ntrembling with fear at facing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch. \\nWhat he dreaded above all was meeting that man again; he \\nhated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred and was \\nafraid his hatred might betray him. His indignation was \\nsuch that he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go \\nin with a cold and arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to \\nkeep as silent as possible, to watch and listen and for once at \\nleast to control his overstrained nerves. At that moment he \\nwas summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.\\nHe found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study. His \\nstudy was a room neither large nor small, furnished with \\na large writing-table, that stood before a sofa, upholstered \\nin checked material, a bureau, a bookcase in the corner \\nand several chairs—all government furniture, of polished \\nyellow wood. In the further wall there was a closed door, be-\\nyond it there were no doubt other rooms. On Raskolnikov’s \\nentrance Porfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by \\nwhich he had come in and they remained alone. He met his \\nvisitor with an apparently genial and good-tempered air, \\nand it was only after a few minutes that Raskolnikov saw \\nsigns of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had \\nbeen thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something \\nvery secret.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf64a\\uf645\\n‘Ah, my dear fellow! Here you are … in our domain’ … \\nbegan Porfiry, holding out both hands to him. ‘Come, sit \\ndown, old man … or perhaps you don’t like to be called ‘my \\ndear fellow’ and ‘old man!’—/tout court? Please don’t think \\nit too familiar…. Here, on the sofa.’\\nRaskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him. \\n‘In our domain,’ the apologies for familiarity, the French \\nphrase tout court were all characteristic signs.\\n‘He held out both hands to me, but he did not give me \\none—he drew it back in time,’ struck him suspiciously. Both \\nwere watching each other, but when their eyes met, quick as \\nlightning they looked away.\\n‘I brought you this paper … about the watch. Here it is. Is \\nit all right or shall I copy it again?’\\n‘What? A paper? Yes, yes, don’t be uneasy, it’s all right,’ \\nPorfiry Petrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had \\nsaid it he took the paper and looked at it. ‘Yes, it’s all right. \\nNothing more is needed,’ he declared with the same rapid-\\nity and he laid the paper on the table.\\nA minute later when he was talking of something else he \\ntook it from the table and put it on his bureau.\\n‘I believe you said yesterday you would like to question \\nme … formally … about my acquaintance with the mur-\\ndered woman?’ Raskolnikov was beginning again. ‘Why \\ndid I put in ‘I believe’’ passed through his mind in a flash. \\n‘Why am I so uneasy at having put in that ‘I believe’?’ came \\nin a second flash.',\n",
              " 'And he suddenly felt that his uneasiness at \\nthe mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the first \\nlooks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, \\n\\uf647\\uf64a\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nand that this was fearfully dangerous. His nerves were \\nquivering, his emotion was increasing. ‘It’s bad, it’s bad! I \\nshall say too much again.’\\n‘Yes, yes, yes! There’s no hurry, there’s no hurry,’ muttered \\nPorfiry Petrovitch, moving to and fro about the table with-\\nout any apparent aim, as it were making dashes towards the \\nwindow, the bureau and the table, at one moment avoiding \\nRaskolnikov’s suspicious glance, then again standing still \\nand looking him straight in the face.\\nHis fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball \\nrolling from one side to the other and rebounding back.\\n‘We’ve plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? \\nHere, a cigarette!’ he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette. \\n‘You know I am receiving you here, but my own quarters \\nare through there, you know, my government quarters. But \\nI am living outside for the time, I had to have some repairs \\ndone here. It’s almost finished now…. Government quar-\\nters, you know, are a capital thing. Eh, what do you think?’\\n‘Yes, a capital thing,’ answered Raskolnikov, looking at \\nhim almost ironically.\\n‘A capital thing, a capital thing,’ repeated Porfiry Petro-\\nvitch, as though he had just thought of something quite \\ndifferent. ‘Yes, a capital thing,’ he almost shouted at last, \\nsuddenly staring at Raskolnikov and stopping short two \\nsteps from him.\\nThis stupid repetition was too incongruous in its inepti-\\ntude with the serious, brooding and enigmatic glance he \\nturned upon his visitor.\\nBut this stirred Raskolnikov’s spleen more than ever and \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf64a\\uf647\\nhe could not resist an ironical and rather incautious chal-\\nlenge.\\n‘Tell me, please,’ he asked suddenly, looking almost in-\\nsolently at him and taking a kind of pleasure in his own \\ninsolence. ‘I believe it’s a sort of legal rule, a sort of legal tra-\\ndition—for all investigating lawyers—to begin their attack \\nfrom afar, with a trivial, or at least an irrelevant subject, so \\nas to encourage, or rather, to divert the man they are cross-\\nexamining, to disarm his caution and then all at once to \\ngive him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal \\nquestion. Isn’t that so? It’s a sacred tradition, mentioned, I \\nfancy, in all the manuals of the art?’\\n‘Yes, yes…. Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke \\nabout government quarters … eh?’\\nAnd as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his \\neyes and winked; a good-humoured, crafty look passed \\nover his face. The wrinkles on his forehead were smoothed \\nout, his eyes contracted, his features broadened and he sud-\\ndenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all \\nover and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face. The latter \\nforced himself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that \\nhe was laughing, broke into such a guffaw that he turned \\nalmost crimson, Raskolnikov’s repulsion overcame all pre-\\ncaution; he left off laughing, scowled and stared with hatred \\nat Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his intention-\\nally prolonged laughter lasted. There was lack of precaution \\non both sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be \\nlaughing in his visitor’s face and to be very little disturbed \\nat the annoyance with which the visitor received it. The lat-\\n\\uf647\\uf64a\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nter fact was very significant in Raskolnikov’s eyes: he saw \\nthat Porfiry Petrovitch had not been embarrassed just be-\\nfore either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps fallen into \\na trap; that there must be something, some motive here un-\\nknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness \\nand in another moment would break upon him …\\nHe went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat \\nand took his cap.\\n‘Porfiry Petrovitch,’ he began resolutely, though with \\nconsiderable irritation, ‘yesterday you expressed a desire \\nthat I should come to you for some inquiries’ (he laid spe-\\ncial stress on the word ‘inquiries’). ‘I have come and if you \\nhave anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow me to with-\\ndraw. I have no time to spare…. I have to be at the funeral \\nof that man who was run over, of whom you … know also,’ \\nhe added, feeling angry at once at having made this addi-\\ntion and more irritated at his anger. ‘I am sick of it all, do \\nyou hear? and have long been. It’s partly what made me ill. \\nIn short,’ he shouted, feeling that the phrase about his ill-\\nness was still more out of place, ‘in short, kindly examine \\nme or let me go, at once. And if you must examine me, do so \\nin the proper form! I will not allow you to do so otherwise, \\nand so meanwhile, good-bye, as we have evidently nothing \\nto keep us now.’\\n‘Good heavens! What do you mean? What shall I ques-\\ntion you about?’ cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change \\nof tone, instantly leaving off laughing. ‘Please don’t disturb \\nyourself,’ he began fidgeting from place to place and fussily \\nmaking Raskolnikov sit down. ‘There’s no hurry, there’s no \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf64a\\uf649\\nhurry, it’s all nonsense. Oh, no, I’m very glad you’ve come \\nto see me at last … I look upon you simply as a visitor. And \\nas for my confounded laughter, please excuse it, Rodion \\nRomanovitch. Rodion Romanovitch? That is your name? \\n… It’s my nerves, you tickled me so with your witty obser-\\nvation; I assure you, sometimes I shake with laughter like \\nan india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time….',\n",
              " 'I’m often \\nafraid of an attack of paralysis. Do sit down. Please do, or I \\nshall think you are angry …’\\nRaskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, \\nstill frowning angrily. He did sit down, but still held his \\ncap.\\n‘I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear Rodion \\nRomanovitch,’ Porfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about \\nthe room and again avoiding his visitor’s eyes. ‘You see, I’m \\na bachelor, a man of no consequence and not used to soci-\\nety; besides, I have nothing before me, I’m set, I’m running \\nto seed and … and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, \\nthat in our Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who \\nare not intimate, but respect each other, like you and me, it \\ntakes them half an hour before they can find a subject for \\nconversation—they are dumb, they sit opposite each oth-\\ner and feel awkward. Everyone has subjects of conversation, \\nladies for instance … people in high society always have \\ntheir subjects of conversation, c’est de rigueur but people of \\nthe middle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always \\ntongue-tied and awkward. What is the reason of it? Wheth-\\ner it is the lack of public interest, or whether it is we are so \\nhonest we don’t want to deceive one another, I don’t know. \\n\\uf647\\uf64a\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nWhat do you think? Do put down your cap, it looks as if \\nyou were just going, it makes me uncomfortable … I am so \\ndelighted …’\\nRaskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening \\nin silence with a serious frowning face to the vague and \\nempty chatter of Porfiry Petrovitch. ‘Does he really want to \\ndistract my attention with his silly babble?’\\n‘I can’t offer you coffee here; but why not spend five min-\\nutes with a friend?’ Porfiry pattered on, ‘and you know all \\nthese official duties … please don’t mind my running up \\nand down, excuse it, my dear fellow, I am very much afraid \\nof offending you, but exercise is absolutely indispensable for \\nme. I’m always sitting and so glad to be moving about for \\nfive minutes … I suffer from my sedentary life … I always \\nintend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all \\nranks, even Privy Councillors, may be seen skipping gaily \\nthere; there you have it, modern science … yes, yes…. But \\nas for my duties here, inquiries and all such formalities … \\nyou mentioned inquiries yourself just now … I assure you \\nthese interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for \\nthe interrogator than for the interrogated…. You made the \\nobservation yourself just now very aptly and wittily.’ (Ras-\\nkolnikov had made no observation of the kind.) ‘One gets \\ninto a muddle! A regular muddle! One keeps harping on \\nthe same note, like a drum! There is to be a reform and we \\nshall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he! And \\nas for our legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thor-\\noughly agree with you. Every prisoner on trial, even the \\nrudest peasant, knows that they begin by disarming him \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf64a\\uf64b\\nwith irrelevant questions (as you so happily put it) and then \\ndeal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he!—your felicitous \\ncomparison, he-he! So you really imagined that I meant by \\n‘government quarters’ … he-he! You are an ironical person. \\nCome. I won’t go on! Ah, by the way, yes! One word leads \\nto another. You spoke of formality just now, apropos of the \\ninquiry, you know. But what’s the use of formality? In many \\ncases it’s nonsense. Sometimes one has a friendly chat and \\ngets a good deal more out of it. One can always fall back on \\nformality, allow me to assure you. And after all, what does \\nit amount to? An examining lawyer cannot be bounded by \\nformality at every step. The work of investigation is, so to \\nspeak, a free art in its own way, he-he-he!’\\nPorfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment. He had sim-\\nply babbled on uttering empty phrases, letting slip a few \\nenigmatic words and again reverting to incoherence. He \\nwas almost running about the room, moving his fat little \\nlegs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with his \\nright hand behind his back, while with his left making ges-\\nticulations that were extraordinarily incongruous with his \\nwords. Raskolnikov suddenly noticed that as he ran about \\nthe room he seemed twice to stop for a moment near the \\ndoor, as though he were listening.\\n‘Is he expecting anything?’\\n‘You are certainly quite right about it,’ Porfiry began \\ngaily, looking with extraordinary simplicity at Raskol-\\nnikov (which startled him and instantly put him on his \\nguard); ‘certainly quite right in laughing so wittily at our \\nlegal forms, he-he! Some of these elaborate psychological \\n\\uf647\\uf64a\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nmethods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if \\none adheres too closely to the forms. Yes … I am talking of \\nforms again. Well, if I recognise, or more strictly speaking, \\nif I suspect someone or other to be a criminal in any case \\nentrusted to me … you’re reading for the law, of course, Ro-\\ndion Romanovitch?’\\n‘Yes, I was …’\\n‘Well, then it is a precedent for you for the future—though \\ndon’t suppose I should venture to instruct you after the ar-\\nticles you publish about crime! No, I simply make bold to \\nstate it by way of fact, if I took this man or that for a criminal, \\nwhy, I ask, should I worry him prematurely, even though I \\nhad evidence against him? In one case I may be bound, for \\ninstance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in \\nquite a different position, you know, so why shouldn’t I let \\nhim walk about the town a bit? he-he-he! But I see you don’t \\nquite understand, so I’ll give you a clearer example. If I put \\nhim in prison too soon, I may very likely give him, so to \\nspeak, moral support, he-he! You’re laughing?’\\nRaskolnikov had no idea of laughing. He was sitting with \\ncompressed lips, his feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petro-\\nvitch’s.\\n‘Yet that is the case, with some types especially, for men \\nare so different. You say ‘evidence’.

By giving him, so to speak, a definite position, I \\nshall put him out of suspense and set his mind at rest, so \\nthat he will retreat into his shell. They say that at Sevastopol, \\nsoon after Alma, the clever people were in a terrible fright \\nthat the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at \\nonce. But when they saw that the enemy preferred a regular \\nsiege, they were delighted, I am told and reassured, for the \\nthing would drag on for two months at least. You’re laugh-\\ning, you don’t believe me again? Of course, you’re right, too. \\nYou’re right, you’re right. These are special cases, I admit. \\nBut you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, \\nthe general case, the case for which all legal forms and rules \\nare intended, for which they are calculated and laid down \\nin books, does not exist at all, for the reason that every case, \\nevery crime, for instance, so soon as it actually occurs, at \\nonce becomes a thoroughly special case and sometimes a \\ncase unlike any that’s gone before. Very comic cases of that \\nsort sometimes occur. If I leave one man quite alone, if I \\ndon’t touch him and don’t worry him, but let him know or \\nat least suspect every moment that I know all about it and \\nam watching him day and night, and if he is in continual \\nsuspicion and terror, he’ll be bound to lose his head. He’ll \\ncome of himself, or maybe do something which will make \\nit as plain as twice two are four—it’s delightful. It may be \\nso with a simple peasant, but with one of our sort, an intel-\\nligent man cultivated on a certain side, it’s a dead certainty. \\n\\uf647\\uf64b1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nFor, my dear fellow, it’s a very important matter to know on \\nwhat side a man is cultivated. And then there are nerves, \\nthere are nerves, you have overlooked them! Why, they are \\nall sick, nervous and irritable! … And then how they all \\nsuffer from spleen! That I assure you is a regular gold-mine \\nfor us. And it’s no anxiety to me, his running about the \\ntown free! Let him, let him walk about for a bit! I know well \\nenough that I’ve caught him and that he won’t escape me. \\nWhere could he escape to, he-he? Abroad, perhaps? A Pole \\nwill escape abroad, but not here, especially as I am watching \\nand have taken measures. Will he escape into the depths of \\nthe country perhaps? But you know, peasants live there, real \\nrude Russian peasants. A modern cultivated man would \\nprefer prison to living with such strangers as our peasants. \\nHe-he! But that’s all nonsense, and on the surface. It’s not \\nmerely that he has nowhere to run to, he is psychologically \\nunable to escape me, he-he! What an expression! Through \\na law of nature he can’t escape me if he had anywhere to go. \\nHave you seen a butterfly round a candle? That’s how he will \\nkeep circling and circling round me. Freedom will lose its \\nattractions. He’ll begin to brood, he’ll weave a tangle round \\nhimself, he’ll worry himself to death! What’s more he will \\nprovide me with a mathematical proof—if I only give him \\nlong enough interval…. And he’ll keep circling round me, \\ngetting nearer and nearer and then—flop! He’ll fly straight \\ninto my mouth and I’ll swallow him, and that will be very \\namusing, he-he-he!

He can’t be \\nshowing off his power with no motive … prompting me; \\nhe is far too clever for that … he must have another object. \\nWhat is it? It’s all nonsense, my friend, you are pretending, \\nto scare me! You’ve no proofs and the man I saw had no \\nreal existence. You simply want to make me lose my head, \\nto work me up beforehand and so to crush me. But you are \\nwrong, you won’t do it! But why give me such a hint? Is he \\nreckoning on my shattered nerves? No, my friend, you are \\nwrong, you won’t do it even though you have some trap for \\nme … let us see what you have in store for me.’\\nAnd he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown or-\\ndeal. At times he longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him. \\nThis anger was what he dreaded from the beginning. He felt \\nthat his parched lips were flecked with foam, his heart was \\nthrobbing. But he was still determined not to speak till the \\nright moment. He realised that this was the best policy in \\nhis position, because instead of saying too much he would \\nbe irritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him \\ninto speaking too freely.

              " 'com\\nman still young, so to say, in your first youth and so you put \\nintellect above everything, like all young people. Playful wit \\nand abstract arguments fascinate you and that’s for all the \\nworld like the old Austrian Hof-kriegsrath as far as I can \\njudge of military matters, that is: on paper they’d beaten \\nNapoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study \\nthey worked it all out in the cleverest fashion, but look you, \\nGeneral Mack surrendered with all his army, he-he-he! I \\nsee, I see, Rodion Romanovitch, you are laughing at a civil-\\nian like me, taking examples out of military history! But I \\ncan’t help it, it’s my weakness. I am fond of military science. \\nAnd I’m ever so fond of reading all military histories. I’ve \\ncertainly missed my proper career. I ought to have been in \\nthe army, upon my word I ought. I shouldn’t have been a \\nNapoleon, but I might have been a major, he-he! Well, I’ll \\ntell you the whole truth, my dear fellow, about this special \\ncase I mean: actual fact and a man’s temperament, my dear \\nsir, are weighty matters and it’s astonishing how they some-\\ntimes deceive the sharpest calculation! I—listen to an old \\nman—am speaking seriously, Rodion Romanovitch’ (as \\nhe said this Porfiry Petrovitch, who was scarcely five-and-\\nthirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even his voice \\nchanged and he seemed to shrink together) ‘Moreover, I’m a \\ncandid man … am I a candid man or not? What do you say? \\nI fancy I really am: I tell you these things for nothing and \\ndon’t even expect a reward for it, he-he! Well, to proceed, wit \\nin my opinion is a splendid thing, it is, so to say, an adorn-\\nment of nature and a consolation of life, and what tricks it \\ncan play! So that it sometimes is hard for a poor examining \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf64b\\uf647\\nlawyer to know where he is, especially when he’s liable to \\nbe carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a \\nman after all! But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal’s \\ntemperament, worse luck for him! But young people carried \\naway by their own wit don’t think of that ‘when they over-\\nstep all obstacles,’ as you wittily and cleverly expressed it \\nyesterday. He will lie—that is, the man who is a special case \\nthe incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion; \\nyou might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of \\nhis wit, but at the most interesting, the most flagrant mo-\\nment he will faint. Of course there may be illness and a \\nstuffy room as well, but anyway! Anyway he’s given us the \\nidea! He lied incomparably, but he didn’t reckon on his tem-\\nperament. That’s what betrays him! Another time he will be \\ncarried away by his playful wit into making fun of the man \\nwho suspects him, he will turn pale as it were on purpose to \\nmislead, but his paleness will be too natural too much like \\nthe real thing, again he has given us an idea! Though his \\nquestioner may be deceived at first, he will think differently \\nnext day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is like that at \\nevery step! He puts himself forward where he is not want-\\ned, speaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings \\nin all sorts of allegorical allusions, he-he! Comes and asks \\nwhy didn’t you take me long ago? he-he-he! And that can \\nhappen, you know, with the cleverest man, the psychologist, \\nthe literary man. The temperament reflects everything like \\na mirror! Gaze into it and admire what you see! But why are \\nyou so pale, Rodion Romanovitch? Is the room stuffy? Shall \\nI open the window?’\\n\\uf647\\uf64b\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘Oh, don’t trouble, please,’ cried Raskolnikov and he sud-\\ndenly broke into a laugh. ‘Please don’t trouble.’\\nPorfiry stood facing him, paused a moment and suddenly \\nhe too laughed. Raskolnikov got up from the sofa, abruptly \\nchecking his hysterical laughter.\\n‘Porfiry Petrovitch,’ he began, speaking loudly and dis-\\ntinctly, though his legs trembled and he could scarcely \\nstand. ‘I see clearly at last that you actually suspect me of \\nmurdering that old woman and her sister Lizaveta. Let me \\ntell you for my part that I am sick of this. If you find that \\nyou have a right to prosecute me legally, to arrest me, then \\nprosecute me, arrest me. But I will not let myself be jeered \\nat to my face and worried …’\\nHis lips trembled, his eyes glowed with fury and he could \\nnot restrain his voice.\\n‘I won’t allow it!’ he shouted, bringing his fist down on \\nthe table. ‘Do you hear that, Porfiry Petrovitch? I won’t al-\\nlow it.’\\n‘Good heavens! What does it mean?’ cried Porfiry Petro-\\nvitch, apparently quite frightened. ‘Rodion Romanovitch, \\nmy dear fellow, what is the matter with you?’\\n‘I won’t allow it,’ Raskolnikov shouted again.\\n‘Hush, my dear man! They’ll hear and come in. Just think, \\nwhat could we say to them?’ Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in \\nhorror, bringing his face close to Raskolnikov’s.\\n‘I won’t allow it, I won’t allow it,’ Raskolnikov repeated \\nmechanically, but he too spoke in a sudden whisper.\\nPorfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window.\\n‘Some fresh air! And you must have some water, my dear \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf64b\\uf649\\nfellow. You’re ill!’ and he was running to the door to call \\nfor some when he found a decanter of water in the corner. \\n‘Come, drink a little,’ he whispered, rushing up to him with \\nthe decanter. ‘It will be sure to do you good.’\\nPorfiry Petrovitch’s alarm and sympathy were so natural \\nthat Raskolnikov was silent and began looking at him with \\nwild curiosity. He did not take the water, however.\\n‘Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, you’ll drive your-\\nself out of your mind, I assure you, ach, ach! Have some \\nwater, do drink a little.’\\nHe forced him to take the glass. Raskolnikov raised it \\nmechanically to his lips, but set it on the table again with \\ndisgust.\\n‘Yes, you’ve had a little attack! You’ll bring back your ill-\\nness again, my dear fellow,’ Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with \\nfriendly sympathy, though he still looked rather discon-\\ncerted. ‘Good heavens, you must take more care of yourself! \\nDmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see me yesterday—I \\nknow, I know, I’ve a nasty, ironical temper, but what they \\nmade of it! … Good heavens, he came yesterday after you’d \\nbeen. We dined and he talked and talked away, and I could \\nonly throw up my hands in despair! Did he come from you? \\nBut do sit down, for mercy’s sake, sit down!’\\n‘No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he \\nwent,’ Raskolnikov answered sharply.',\n",
              " '‘You knew?’\\n‘I knew. What of it?’\\n‘Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than \\nthat about you; I know about everything. I know how you \\n\\uf647\\uf64b\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nwent to take a flat at night when it was dark and how you \\nrang the bell and asked about the blood, so that the work-\\nmen and the porter did not know what to make of it. Yes, \\nI understand your state of mind at that time … but you’ll \\ndrive yourself mad like that, upon my word! You’ll lose your \\nhead! You’re full of generous indignation at the wrongs \\nyou’ve received, first from destiny, and then from the police \\nofficers, and so you rush from one thing to another to force \\nthem to speak out and make an end of it all, because you \\nare sick of all this suspicion and foolishness. That’s so, isn’t \\nit? I have guessed how you feel, haven’t I? Only in that way \\nyou’ll lose your head and Razumihin’s, too; he’s too good \\na man for such a position, you must know that. You are ill \\nand he is good and your illness is infectious for him … I’ll \\ntell you about it when you are more yourself…. But do sit \\ndown, for goodness’ sake. Please rest, you look shocking, do \\nsit down.’\\nRaskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was \\nhot all over. In amazement he listened with strained atten-\\ntion to Porfiry Petrovitch who still seemed frightened as he \\nlooked after him with friendly solicitude. But he did not be-\\nlieve a word he said, though he felt a strange inclination to \\nbelieve. Porfiry’s unexpected words about the flat had ut-\\nterly overwhelmed him. ‘How can it be, he knows about the \\nflat then,’ he thought suddenly, ‘and he tells it me himself!’\\n‘Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exact-\\nly similar, a case of morbid psychology,’ Porfiry went on \\nquickly. ‘A man confessed to murder and how he kept it up! \\nIt was a regular hallucination; he brought forward facts, he \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf64b\\uf64b\\nimposed upon everyone and why? He had been partly, but \\nonly partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when \\nhe knew that he had given the murderers the opportunity, \\nhe sank into dejection, it got on his mind and turned his \\nbrain, he began imagining things and he persuaded him-\\nself that he was the murderer. But at last the High Court of \\nAppeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and \\nput under proper care. Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-\\ntut-tut! Why, my dear fellow, you may drive yourself into \\ndelirium if you have the impulse to work upon your nerves, \\nto go ringing bells at night and asking about blood! I’ve \\nstudied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man \\nis sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a \\nbelfry. Just the same with bell-ringing…. It’s all illness, Ro-\\ndion Romanovitch! You have begun to neglect your illness. \\nYou should consult an experienced doctor, what’s the good \\nof that fat fellow? You are lightheaded! You were delirious \\nwhen you did all this!’\\nFor a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round.\\n‘Is it possible, is it possible,’ flashed through his mind, \\n‘that he is still lying? He can’t be, he can’t be.’ He rejected \\nthat idea, feeling to what a degree of fury it might drive him, \\nfeeling that that fury might drive him mad.\\n‘I was not delirious. I knew what I was doing,’ he cried, \\nstraining every faculty to penetrate Porfiry’s game, ‘I was \\nquite myself, do you hear?’\\n‘Yes, I hear and understand. You said yesterday you \\nwere not delirious, you were particularly emphatic about \\nit! I understand all you can tell me! A-ach! … Listen, Ro-\\n\\uf647\\uf64b\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ndion Romanovitch, my dear fellow. If you were actually \\na criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable \\nbusiness, would you insist that you were not delirious but in \\nfull possession of your faculties? And so emphatically and \\npersistently? Would it be possible? Quite impossible, to my \\nthinking. If you had anything on your conscience, you cer-\\ntainly ought to insist that you were delirious. That’s so, isn’t \\nit?’\\nThere was a note of slyness in this inquiry. Raskolnikov \\ndrew back on the sofa as Porfiry bent over him and stared \\nin silent perplexity at him.\\n‘Another thing about Razumihin—you certainly ought \\nto have said that he came of his own accord, to have con-\\ncealed your part in it! But you don’t conceal it! You lay stress \\non his coming at your instigation.’\\nRaskolnikov had not done so. A chill went down his \\nback.\\n‘You keep telling lies,’ he said slowly and weakly, twisting \\nhis lips into a sickly smile, ‘you are trying again to show that \\nyou know all my game, that you know all I shall say before-\\nhand,’ he said, conscious himself that he was not weighing \\nhis words as he ought. ‘You want to frighten me … or you \\nare simply laughing at me …’\\nHe still stared at him as he said this and again there was \\na light of intense hatred in his eyes.\\n‘You keep lying,’ he said. ‘You know perfectly well that \\nthe best policy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly \\nas possible … to conceal as little as possible. I don’t believe \\nyou!’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf64c0\\n‘What a wily person you are!’ Porfiry tittered, ‘there’s no \\ncatching you; you’ve a perfect monomania. So you don’t be-\\nlieve me? But still you do believe me, you believe a quarter; \\nI’ll soon make you believe the whole, because I have a sin-\\ncere liking for you and genuinely wish you good.',\n",
              " '’\\nRaskolnikov’s lips trembled.\\n‘Yes, I do,’ went on Porfiry, touching Raskolnikov’s arm \\ngenially, ‘you must take care of your illness. Besides, your \\nmother and sister are here now; you must think of them. \\nYou must soothe and comfort them and you do nothing but \\nfrighten them …’\\n‘What has that to do with you? How do you know it? \\nWhat concern is it of yours? You are keeping watch on me \\nand want to let me know it?’\\n‘Good heavens! Why, I learnt it all from you yourself! \\nYou don’t notice that in your excitement you tell me and \\nothers everything. From Razumihin, too, I learnt a num-\\nber of interesting details yesterday. No, you interrupted me, \\nbut I must tell you that, for all your wit, your suspicious-\\nness makes you lose the common-sense view of things. To \\nreturn to bell-ringing, for instance. I, an examining lawyer, \\nhave betrayed a precious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a \\nfact worth having), and you see nothing in it! Why, if I had \\nthe slightest suspicion of you, should I have acted like that? \\nNo, I should first have disarmed your suspicions and not let \\nyou see I knew of that fact, should have diverted your atten-\\ntion and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your \\nexpression) saying: ‘And what were you doing, sir, pray, at \\nten or nearly eleven at the murdered woman’s flat and why \\n\\uf647\\uf64c1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ndid you ring the bell and why did you ask about blood? And \\nwhy did you invite the porters to go with you to the police \\nstation, to the lieutenant?’ That’s how I ought to have acted \\nif I had a grain of suspicion of you. I ought to have taken \\nyour evidence in due form, searched your lodging and per-\\nhaps have arrested you, too … so I have no suspicion of you, \\nsince I have not done that! But you can’t look at it normally \\nand you see nothing, I say again.’\\nRaskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not \\nfail to perceive it.\\n‘You are lying all the while,’ he cried, ‘I don’t know your \\nobject, but you are lying. You did not speak like that just \\nnow and I cannot be mistaken!’\\n‘I am lying?’ Porfiry repeated, apparently incensed, but \\npreserving a good-humoured and ironical face, as though \\nhe were not in the least concerned at Raskolnikov’s opinion \\nof him. ‘I am lying … but how did I treat you just now, I, \\nthe examining lawyer? Prompting you and giving you ev-\\nery means for your defence; illness, I said, delirium, injury, \\nmelancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it? Ah! \\nHe-he-he! Though, indeed, all those psychological means of \\ndefence are not very reliable and cut both ways: illness, de-\\nlirium, I don’t remember—that’s all right, but why, my good \\nsir, in your illness and in your delirium were you haunted \\nby just those delusions and not by any others? There may \\nhave been others, eh? He-he-he!’\\nRaskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at \\nhim.\\n‘Briefly,’ he said loudly and imperiously, rising to his feet \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf64c\\uf645\\nand in so doing pushing Porfiry back a little, ‘briefly, I want \\nto know, do you acknowledge me perfectly free from suspi-\\ncion or not? Tell me, Porfiry Petrovitch, tell me once for all \\nand make haste!’\\n‘What a business I’m having with you!’ cried Porfiry with \\na perfectly good-humoured, sly and composed face. ‘And \\nwhy do you want to know, why do you want to know so \\nmuch, since they haven’t begun to worry you? Why, you are \\nlike a child asking for matches! And why are you so uneasy? \\nWhy do you force yourself upon us, eh? He-he-he!’\\n‘I repeat,’ Raskolnikov cried furiously, ‘that I can’t put up \\nwith it!’\\n‘With what? Uncertainty?’ interrupted Porfiry.\\n‘Don’t jeer at me! I won’t have it! I tell you I won’t have \\nit. I can’t and I won’t, do you hear, do you hear?’ he shouted, \\nbringing his fist down on the table again.\\n‘Hush! Hush! They’ll overhear! I warn you seriously, take \\ncare of yourself. I am not joking,’ Porfiry whispered, but \\nthis time there was not the look of old womanish good na-\\nture and alarm in his face. Now he was peremptory, stern, \\nfrowning and for once laying aside all mystification.\\nBut this was only for an instant. Raskolnikov, bewil-\\ndered, suddenly fell into actual frenzy, but, strange to say, \\nhe again obeyed the command to speak quietly, though he \\nwas in a perfect paroxysm of fury.\\n‘I will not allow myself to be tortured,’ he whispered, \\ninstantly recognising with hatred that he could not help \\nobeying the command and driven to even greater fury by \\nthe thought. ‘Arrest me, search me, but kindly act in due \\n\\uf647\\uf64c\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nform and don’t play with me! Don’t dare!’\\n‘Don’t worry about the form,’ Porfiry interrupted with \\nthe same sly smile, as it were, gloating with enjoyment over \\nRaskolnikov. ‘I invited you to see me quite in a friendly \\nway.’\\n‘I don’t want your friendship and I spit on it! Do you \\nhear? And, here, I take my cap and go. What will you say \\nnow if you mean to arrest me?’\\nHe took up his cap and went to the door.\\n‘And won’t you see my little surprise?’ chuckled Porfiry, \\nagain taking him by the arm and stopping him at the door.\\nHe seemed to become more playful and good-humoured \\nwhich maddened Raskolnikov.\\n‘What surprise?’ he asked, standing still and looking at \\nPorfiry in alarm.\\n‘My little surprise, it’s sitting there behind the door, he-\\nhe-he!’ (He pointed to the locked door.) ‘I locked him in \\nthat he should not escape.’\\n‘What is it? Where? What? …’\\nRaskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened \\nit, but it was locked.\\n‘It’s locked, here is the key!’\\nAnd he brought a key out of his pocket.\\n‘You are lying,’ roared Raskolnikov without restraint, \\n‘you lie, you damned punchinello!’ and he rushed at Porfiry \\nwho retreated to the other door, not at all alarmed.\\n‘I understand it all! You are lying and mocking so that I \\nmay betray myself to you …’\\n‘Why, you could not betray yourself any further, my dear \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf647\\uf64c\\uf647\\nRodion Romanovitch.

He was a little taken \\naback.\\n‘My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!’ he flew up to \\nhim, ‘this won’t do; I’m afraid you must go … it’s no good \\nyour staying … I will … you see, what a surprise! … Good-\\nbye!’\\nAnd taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door.\\n‘I suppose you didn’t expect it?’ said Raskolnikov who, \\nthough he had not yet fully grasped the situation, had re-\\ngained his courage.\\n‘You did not expect it either, my friend. See how your \\nhand is trembling! He-he!’\\n‘You’re trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!’\\n‘Yes, I am; I didn’t expect it.’\\nThey were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for \\nRaskolnikov to be gone.\\n‘And your little surprise, aren’t you going to show it to \\nme?’ Raskolnikov said, sarcastically.\\n‘Why, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he! You are \\nan ironical person! Come, till we meet!’\\n‘I believe we can say good-bye!’\\n‘That’s in God’s hands,’ muttered Porfiry, with an unnat-\\nural smile.\\nAs he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed \\nthat many people were looking at him. Among them he saw \\n\\uf647\\uf64c\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthe two porters from the house, whom he had invited that \\nnight to the police station. They stood there waiting. But \\nhe was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of \\nPorfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the \\nlatter running after him, out of breath.\\n‘One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it’s in \\nGod’s hands, but as a matter of form there are some ques-\\ntions I shall have to ask you … so we shall meet again, shan’t \\nwe?’\\nAnd Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.\\n‘Shan’t we?’ he added again.\\nHe seemed to want to say something more, but could not \\nspeak out.\\n‘You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has \\njust passed … I lost my temper,’ began Raskolnikov, who \\nhad so far regained his courage that he felt irresistibly in-\\nclined to display his coolness.\\n‘Don’t mention it, don’t mention it,’ Porfiry replied, al-\\nmost gleefully. ‘I myself, too … I have a wicked temper, I \\nadmit it! But we shall meet again. If it’s God’s will, we may \\nsee a great deal of one another.’\\n‘And will get to know each other through and through?’ \\nadded Raskolnikov.\\n‘Yes; know each other through and through,’ assented \\nPorfiry Petrovitch, and he screwed up his eyes, looking \\nearnestly at Raskolnikov. ‘Now you’re going to a birthday \\nparty?’\\n‘To a funeral.’\\n‘Of course, the funeral! Take care of yourself, and get \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64800\\nwell.’\\n‘I don’t know what to wish you,’ said Raskolnikov, who \\nhad begun to descend the stairs, but looked back again.',\n",
              " '‘I \\nshould like to wish you success, but your office is such a \\ncomical one.’\\n‘Why comical?’ Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but \\nhe seemed to prick up his ears at this.\\n‘Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing \\nthat poor Nikolay psychologically, after your fashion, till he \\nconfessed! You must have been at him day and night, prov-\\ning to him that he was the murderer, and now that he has \\nconfessed, you’ll begin vivisecting him again. ‘You are ly-\\ning,’ you’ll say. ‘You are not the murderer! You can’t be! It’s \\nnot your own tale you are telling!’ You must admit it’s a \\ncomical business!’\\n‘He-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just \\nnow that it was not his own tale he was telling?’\\n‘How could I help noticing it!’\\n‘He-he! You are quick-witted. You notice everything! \\nYou’ve really a playful mind! And you always fasten on the \\ncomic side … he-he! They say that was the marked charac-\\nteristic of Gogol, among the writers.’\\n‘Yes, of Gogol.’\\n‘Yes, of Gogol…. I shall look forward to meeting you.’\\n‘So shall I.’\\nRaskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled \\nand bewildered that on getting home he sat for a quarter of \\nan hour on the sofa, trying to collect his thoughts. He did \\nnot attempt to think about Nikolay; he was stupefied; he \\n\\uf64801\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nfelt that his confession was something inexplicable, amaz-\\ning—something beyond his understanding. But Nikolay’s \\nconfession was an actual fact. The consequences of this fact \\nwere clear to him at once, its falsehood could not fail to be \\ndiscovered, and then they would be after him again. Till \\nthen, at least, he was free and must do something for him-\\nself, for the danger was imminent.\\nBut how imminent? His position gradually became clear \\nto him. Remembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his \\nrecent scene with Porfiry, he could not help shuddering \\nagain with horror. Of course, he did not yet know all Por-\\nfiry’s aims, he could not see into all his calculations. But he \\nhad already partly shown his hand, and no one knew bet-\\nter than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry’s ‘lead’ had been \\nfor him. A little more and he might have given himself away \\ncompletely, circumstantially. Knowing his nervous temper-\\nament and from the first glance seeing through him, Porfiry, \\nthough playing a bold game, was bound to win. There’s \\nno denying that Raskolnikov had compromised himself \\nseriously, but no facts had come to light as yet; there was \\nnothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the po-\\nsition? Wasn’t he mistaken? What had Porfiry been trying \\nto get at? Had he really some surprise prepared for him? \\nAnd what was it? Had he really been expecting something \\nor not? How would they have parted if it had not been for \\nthe unexpected appearance of Nikolay?\\nPorfiry had shown almost all his cards—of course, he \\nhad risked something in showing them—and if he had re-\\nally had anything up his sleeve (Raskolnikov reflected), he \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6480\\uf645\\nwould have shown that, too. What was that ‘surprise’? Was \\nit a joke? Had it meant anything? Could it have concealed \\nanything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence? His yes-\\nterday’s visitor? What had become of him? Where was he \\nto-day? If Porfiry really had any evidence, it must be con-\\nnected with him….\\nHe sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his \\nface hidden in his hands. He was still shivering nervously. \\nAt last he got up, took his cap, thought a minute, and went \\nto the door.\\nHe had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, \\nhe might consider himself out of danger. He had a sudden \\nsense almost of joy; he wanted to make haste to Katerina \\nIvanovna’s. He would be too late for the funeral, of course, \\nbut he would be in time for the memorial dinner, and there \\nat once he would see Sonia.\\nHe stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile \\ncame for a moment on to his lips.\\n‘To-day! To-day,’ he repeated to himself. ‘Yes, to-day! So \\nit must be….’\\nBut as he was about to open the door, it began opening of \\nitself. He started and moved back. The door opened gently \\nand slowly, and there suddenly appeared a figure—yester-\\nday’s visitor from underground.\\nThe man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov \\nwithout speaking, and took a step forward into the room. \\nHe was exactly the same as yesterday; the same figure, the \\nsame dress, but there was a great change in his face; he \\nlooked dejected and sighed deeply.',\n",
              " 'If he had only put his \\n\\uf6480\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nhand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he \\nwould have looked exactly like a peasant woman.\\n‘What do you want?’ asked Raskolnikov, numb with ter-\\nror. The man was still silent, but suddenly he bowed down \\nalmost to the ground, touching it with his finger.\\n‘What is it?’ cried Raskolnikov.\\n‘I have sinned,’ the man articulated softly.\\n‘How?’\\n‘By evil thoughts.’\\nThey looked at one another.\\n‘I was vexed. When you came, perhaps in drink, and \\nbade the porters go to the police station and asked about \\nthe blood, I was vexed that they let you go and took you for \\ndrunken. I was so vexed that I lost my sleep. And remem-\\nbering the address we came here yesterday and asked for \\nyou….’\\n‘Who came?’ Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly begin-\\nning to recollect.\\n‘I did, I’ve wronged you.’\\n‘Then you come from that house?’\\n‘I was standing at the gate with them … don’t you re-\\nmember? We have carried on our trade in that house for \\nyears past. We cure and prepare hides, we take work home \\n… most of all I was vexed….’\\nAnd the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the \\ngateway came clearly before Raskolnikov’s mind; he recol-\\nlected that there had been several people there besides the \\nporters, women among them. He remembered one voice \\nhad suggested taking him straight to the police- station. He \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6480\\uf647\\ncould not recall the face of the speaker, and even now he \\ndid not recognise it, but he remembered that he had turned \\nround and made him some answer….\\nSo this was the solution of yesterday’s horror. The most \\nawful thought was that he had been actually almost lost, \\nhad almost done for himself on account of such a trivial cir-\\ncumstance. So this man could tell nothing except his asking \\nabout the flat and the blood stains. So Porfiry, too, had noth-\\ning but that delirium no facts but this psychology which cuts \\nboth ways nothing positive. So if no more facts come to light \\n(and they must not, they must not!) then … then what can \\nthey do to him? How can they convict him, even if they ar-\\nrest him? And Porfiry then had only just heard about the \\nflat and had not known about it before.\\n‘Was it you who told Porfiry … that I’d been there?’ he \\ncried, struck by a sudden idea.\\n‘What Porfiry?’\\n‘The head of the detective department?’\\n‘Yes. The porters did not go there, but I went.’\\n‘To-day?’\\n‘I got there two minutes before you. And I heard, I heard \\nit all, how he worried you.’\\n‘Where? What? When?’\\n‘Why, in the next room. I was sitting there all the time.’\\n‘What? Why, then you were the surprise? But how could \\nit happen? Upon my word!’\\n‘I saw that the porters did not want to do what I said,’ be-\\ngan the man; ‘for it’s too late, said they, and maybe he’ll be \\nangry that we did not come at the time. I was vexed and I \\n\\uf6480\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nlost my sleep, and I began making inquiries. And finding \\nout yesterday where to go, I went to-day. The first time I \\nwent he wasn’t there, when I came an hour later he couldn’t \\nsee me. I went the third time, and they showed me in. I \\ninformed him of everything, just as it happened, and he be-\\ngan skipping about the room and punching himself on the \\nchest. ‘What do you scoundrels mean by it? If I’d known \\nabout it I should have arrested him!’ Then he ran out, called \\nsomebody and began talking to him in the corner, then he \\nturned to me, scolding and questioning me. He scolded me \\na great deal; and I told him everything, and I told him that \\nyou didn’t dare to say a word in answer to me yesterday and \\nthat you didn’t recognise me.',\n",
              " 'And he fell to running about \\nagain and kept hitting himself on the chest, and getting an-\\ngry and running about, and when you were announced he \\ntold me to go into the next room. ‘Sit there a bit,’ he said. \\n‘Don’t move, whatever you may hear.’ And he set a chair \\nthere for me and locked me in. ‘Perhaps,’ he said, ‘I may call \\nyou.’ And when Nikolay’d been brought he let me out as \\nsoon as you were gone. ‘I shall send for you again and ques-\\ntion you,’ he said.’\\n‘And did he question Nikolay while you were there?’\\n‘He got rid of me as he did of you, before he spoke to \\nNikolay.’\\nThe man stood still, and again suddenly bowed down, \\ntouching the ground with his finger.\\n‘Forgive me for my evil thoughts, and my slander.’\\n‘May God forgive you,’ answered Raskolnikov.\\nAnd as he said this, the man bowed down again, but not \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6480\\uf649\\nto the ground, turned slowly and went out of the room.\\n‘It all cuts both ways, now it all cuts both ways,’ repeated \\nRaskolnikov, and he went out more confident than ever.\\n‘Now we’ll make a fight for it,’ he said, with a malicious \\nsmile, as he went down the stairs.

Intensely unpleasant as it \\nwas, he was forced little by little to accept as a fact beyond \\nrecall what had seemed to him only the day before fan-\\ntastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity \\nhad been gnawing at his heart all night. When he got out \\nof bed, Pyotr Petrovitch immediately looked in the look-\\ning-glass. He was afraid that he had jaundice. However his \\nhealth seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at his noble, \\nclear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of late, \\nPyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in \\nthe conviction that he would find another bride and, per-\\nhaps, even a better one. But coming back to the sense of \\nhis present position, he turned aside and spat vigorously, \\nwhich excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey Semyonovitch \\nLebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was stay-\\ning. That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it \\ndown against his young friend’s account. He had set down \\na good many points against him of late. His anger was re-\\ndoubled when he reflected that he ought not to have told \\nAndrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday’s inter-\\nview. That was the second mistake he had made in temper, \\nthrough impulsiveness and irritability…. Moreover, all that \\n\\uf6480\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nmorning one unpleasantness followed another. He even \\nfound a hitch awaiting him in his legal case in the senate. \\nHe was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat which \\nhad been taken in view of his approaching marriage and \\nwas being redecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich \\nGerman tradesman, would not entertain the idea of break-\\ning the contract which had just been signed and insisted \\non the full forfeit money, though Pyotr Petrovitch would \\nbe giving him back the flat practically redecorated. In the \\nsame way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble \\nof the instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not \\nyet removed to the flat.\\n‘Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?’ \\nPyotr Petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once \\nmore he had a gleam of desperate hope. ‘Can all that be re-\\nally so irrevocably over? Is it no use to make another effort?’ \\nThe thought of Dounia sent a voluptuous pang through his \\nheart. He endured anguish at that moment, and if it had \\nbeen possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it, \\nPyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.\\n‘It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money,’ \\nhe thought, as he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov’s \\nroom, ‘and why on earth was I such a Jew? It was false econ-\\nomy! I meant to keep them without a penny so that they \\nshould turn to me as their providence, and look at them! \\nfoo! If I’d spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for \\nthe trousseau and presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, \\njewellery, materials, and all that sort of trash from Knopp’s \\nand the English shop, my position would have been better \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64810\\nand … stronger! They could not have refused me so easily! \\nThey are the sort of people that would feel bound to return \\nmoney and presents if they broke it off; and they would find \\nit hard to do it! And their conscience would prick them: \\nhow can we dismiss a man who has hitherto been so gener-\\nous and delicate?…. H’m! I’ve made a blunder.’\\nAnd grinding his teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called \\nhimself a fool— but not aloud, of course.\\nHe returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before. \\nThe preparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanov-\\nna’s excited his curiosity as he passed.',\n",
              " 'He had heard about it \\nthe day before; he fancied, indeed, that he had been invited, \\nbut absorbed in his own cares he had paid no attention. In-\\nquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy laying the \\ntable while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he \\nheard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all \\nthe lodgers had been invited, among them some who had \\nnot known the dead man, that even Andrey Semyonovitch \\nLebeziatnikov was invited in spite of his previous quarrel \\nwith Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch, was not \\nonly invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most \\nimportant of the lodgers. Amalia Ivanovna herself had been \\ninvited with great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleas-\\nantness, and so she was very busy with preparations and \\nwas taking a positive pleasure in them; she was moreover \\ndressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she was \\nproud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch \\nand he went into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikov’s, some-\\nwhat thoughtful. He had learnt that Raskolnikov was to be \\n\\uf64811\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\none of the guests.\\nAndrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morn-\\ning. The attitude of Pyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was \\nstrange, though perhaps natural. Pyotr Petrovitch had de-\\nspised and hated him from the day he came to stay with him \\nand at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. He \\nhad not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg \\nsimply from parsimony, though that had been perhaps his \\nchief object. He had heard of Andrey Semyonovitch, who \\nhad once been his ward, as a leading young progressive who \\nwas taking an important part in certain interesting circles, \\nthe doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had \\nimpressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient cir-\\ncles who despised everyone and showed everyone up had \\nlong inspired in him a peculiar but quite vague alarm. He \\nhad not, of course, been able to form even an approximate \\nnotion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had heard \\nthat there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of \\nsome sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he ex-\\naggerated and distorted the significance of those words to \\nan absurd degree. What for many years past he had feared \\nmore than anything was being shown up and this was the \\nchief ground for his continual uneasiness at the thought of \\ntransferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of \\nthis as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some \\nyears before, when he was just entering on his own career, \\nhe had come upon two cases in which rather important \\npersonages in the province, patrons of his, had been cruelly \\nshown up. One instance had ended in great scandal for the \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6481\\uf645\\nperson attacked and the other had very nearly ended in se-\\nrious trouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to \\ngo into the subject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if \\nnecessary, to anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour \\nof ‘our younger generation.’ He relied on Andrey Semyo-\\nnovitch for this and before his visit to Raskolnikov he had \\nsucceeded in picking up some current phrases. He soon \\ndiscovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace \\nsimpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. \\nEven if he had been certain that all the progressives were \\nfools like him, it would not have allayed his uneasiness. All \\nthe doctrines, the ideas, the systems, with which Andrey \\nSemyonovitch pestered him had no interest for him. He had \\nhis own object—he simply wanted to find out at once what \\nwas happening here. Had these people any power or not? \\nHad he anything to fear from them? Would they expose any \\nenterprise of his? And what precisely was now the object of \\ntheir attacks? Could he somehow make up to them and get \\nround them if they really were powerful? Was this the thing \\nto do or not? Couldn’t he gain something through them? In \\nfact hundreds of questions presented themselves.\\nAndrey Semyonovitch was an anæmic, scrofulous little \\nman, with strangely flaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which \\nhe was very proud. He was a clerk and had almost always \\nsomething wrong with his eyes. He was rather soft-heart-\\ned, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited \\nin speech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with \\nhis little figure. He was one of the lodgers most respected \\nby Amalia Ivanovna, for he did not get drunk and paid reg-\\n\\uf6481\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitch really was \\nrather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress \\nand ‘our younger generation’ from enthusiasm. He was one \\nof the numerous and varied legion of dullards, of half-an-\\nimate abortions, conceited, half-educated coxcombs, who \\nattach themselves to the idea most in fashion only to vul-\\ngarise it and who caricature every cause they serve, however \\nsincerely.\\nThough Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he, too, was \\nbeginning to dislike Pyotr Petrovitch. This happened on \\nboth sides unconsciously. However simple Andrey Semyo-\\nnovitch might be, he began to see that Pyotr Petrovitch was \\nduping him and secretly despising him, and that ‘he was \\nnot the right sort of man.’ He had tried expounding to him \\nthe system of Fourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late \\nPyotr Petrovitch began to listen too sarcastically and even \\nto be rude. The fact was he had begun instinctively to guess \\nthat Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace simple-\\nton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections \\nof any consequence even in his own circle, but had simply \\npicked things up third-hand; and that very likely he did \\nnot even know much about his own work of propaganda, \\nfor he was in too great a muddle. A fine person he would \\nbe to show anyone up! It must be noted, by the way, that \\nPyotr Petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accept-\\ned the strangest praise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had \\nnot protested, for instance, when Andrey Semyonovitch \\nbelauded him for being ready to contribute to the establish-\\nment of the new ‘commune,’ or to abstain from christening \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6481\\uf647\\nhis future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take \\na lover a month after marriage, and so on. Pyotr Petrovitch \\nso enjoyed hearing his own praises that he did not disdain \\neven such virtues when they were attributed to him.',\n",
              " 'Pyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to re-\\nalise some five- per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the \\ntable and counted over bundles of notes. Andrey Semyo-\\nnovitch who hardly ever had any money walked about the \\nroom pretending to himself to look at all those bank notes \\nwith indifference and even contempt. Nothing would have \\nconvinced Pyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch \\ncould really look on the money unmoved, and the latter, on \\nhis side, kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr Petrovitch was \\ncapable of entertaining such an idea about him and was, \\nperhaps, glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend \\nby reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference \\nbetween them.\\nHe found him incredibly inattentive and irritable, though \\nhe, Andrey Semyonovitch, began enlarging on his favourite \\nsubject, the foundation of a new special ‘commune.’ The \\nbrief remarks that dropped from Pyotr Petrovitch between \\nthe clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame betrayed \\nunmistakable and discourteous irony. But the ‘humane’ \\nAndrey Semyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitch’s ill-hu-\\nmour to his recent breach with Dounia and he was burning \\nwith impatience to discourse on that theme. He had some-\\nthing progressive to say on the subject which might console \\nhis worthy friend and ‘could not fail’ to promote his devel-\\nopment.\\n\\uf6481\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘There is some sort of festivity being prepared at that … \\nat the widow’s, isn’t there?’ Pyotr Petrovitch asked suddenly, \\ninterrupting Andrey Semyonovitch at the most interesting \\npassage.\\n‘Why, don’t you know? Why, I was telling you last night \\nwhat I think about all such ceremonies. And she invited you \\ntoo, I heard. You were talking to her yesterday …’\\n‘I should never have expected that beggarly fool would \\nhave spent on this feast all the money she got from that \\nother fool, Raskolnikov. I was surprised just now as I came \\nthrough at the preparations there, the wines! Several people \\nare invited. It’s beyond everything!’ continued Pyotr Petro-\\nvitch, who seemed to have some object in pursuing the \\nconversation. ‘What? You say I am asked too? When was \\nthat? I don’t remember. But I shan’t go. Why should I? I only \\nsaid a word to her in passing yesterday of the possibility of \\nher obtaining a year’s salary as a destitute widow of a gov-\\nernment clerk.

It’s a duty of every man to work \\nfor enlightenment and propaganda and the more harshly, \\nperhaps, the better. I might drop a seed, an idea…. And \\nsomething might grow up from that seed. How should \\nI be insulting them? They might be offended at first, but \\nafterwards they’d see I’d done them a service. You know, \\nTerebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamed be-\\ncause when she left her family and … devoted … herself, \\nshe wrote to her father and mother that she wouldn’t go on \\nliving conventionally and was entering on a free marriage \\nand it was said that that was too harsh, that she might have \\nspared them and have written more kindly. I think that’s \\nall nonsense and there’s no need of softness; on the con-\\ntrary, what’s wanted is protest. Varents had been married \\nseven years, she abandoned her two children, she told her \\nhusband straight out in a letter: ‘I have realised that I can-\\nnot be happy with you. I can never forgive you that you \\nhave deceived me by concealing from me that there is an-\\nother organisation of society by means of the communities. \\nI have only lately learned it from a great-hearted man to \\nwhom I have given myself and with whom I am establishing \\na community. I speak plainly because I consider it dishon-\\nest to deceive you. Do as you think best. Do not hope to get \\nme back, you are too late. I hope you will be happy.’ That’s \\nhow letters like that ought to be written!’\\n‘Is that Terebyeva the one you said had made a third free \\nmarriage?’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6481\\uf64b\\n‘No, it’s only the second, really! But what if it were the \\nfourth, what if it were the fifteenth, that’s all nonsense! \\nAnd if ever I regretted the death of my father and mother, \\nit is now, and I sometimes think if my parents were living \\nwhat a protest I would have aimed at them! I would have \\ndone something on purpose … I would have shown them! \\nI would have astonished them! I am really sorry there is no \\none!’\\n‘To surprise! He-he! Well, be that as you will,’ Pyotr \\nPetrovitch interrupted, ‘but tell me this; do you know the \\ndead man’s daughter, the delicate-looking little thing? It’s \\ntrue what they say about her, isn’t it?’\\n‘What of it? I think, that is, it is my own personal convic-\\ntion that this is the normal condition of women. Why not? I \\nmean, distinguons. In our present society it is not altogether \\nnormal, because it is compulsory, but in the future society it \\nwill be perfectly normal, because it will be voluntary. Even \\nas it is, she was quite right: she was suffering and that was \\nher asset, so to speak, her capital which she had a perfect \\nright to dispose of. Of course, in the future society there \\nwill be no need of assets, but her part will have another sig-\\nnificance, rational and in harmony with her environment. \\nAs to Sofya Semyonovna personally, I regard her action as \\na vigorous protest against the organisation of society, and \\nI respect her deeply for it; I rejoice indeed when I look at \\nher!’\\n‘I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings.’\\nLebeziatnikov was enraged.\\n‘That’s another slander,’ he yelled. ‘It was not so at all! \\n\\uf6481\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nThat was all Katerina Ivanovna’s invention, for she did not \\nunderstand! And I never made love to Sofya Semyonovna! \\nI was simply developing her, entirely disinterestedly, trying \\nto rouse her to protest…. All I wanted was her protest and \\nSofya Semyonovna could not have remained here anyway!’\\n‘Have you asked her to join your community?’\\n‘You keep on laughing and very inappropriately, allow me \\nto tell you. You don’t understand! There is no such rôle in a \\ncommunity. The community is established that there should \\nbe no such rôles. In a community, such a rôle is essentially \\ntransformed and what is stupid here is sensible there, what, \\nunder present conditions, is unnatural becomes perfectly \\nnatural in the community. It all depends on the environ-\\nment. It’s all the environment and man himself is nothing. \\nAnd I am on good terms with Sofya Semyonovna to this \\nday, which is a proof that she never regarded me as having \\nwronged her. I am trying now to attract her to the commu-\\nnity, but on quite, quite a different footing. What are you \\nlaughing at? We are trying to establish a community of our \\nown, a special one, on a broader basis. We have gone fur-\\nther in our convictions. We reject more! And meanwhile \\nI’m still developing Sofya Semyonovna. She has a beautiful, \\nbeautiful character!’\\n‘And you take advantage of her fine character, eh? He-\\nhe!’\\n‘No, no! Oh, no! On the contrary.’\\n‘Oh, on the contrary! He-he-he! A queer thing to say!’\\n‘Believe me! Why should I disguise it? In fact, I feel it \\nstrange myself how timid, chaste and modern she is with \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf6450\\nme!’\\n‘And you, of course, are developing her … he-he! trying \\nto prove to her that all that modesty is nonsense?’\\n‘Not at all, not at all! How coarsely, how stupidly—excuse \\nme saying so—you misunderstand the word development! \\nGood heavens, how … crude you still are! We are striving \\nfor the freedom of women and you have only one idea in \\nyour head…. Setting aside the general question of chastity \\nand feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed \\nprejudices, I fully accept her chastity with me, because \\nthat’s for her to decide. Of course if she were to tell me her-\\nself that she wanted me, I should think myself very lucky, \\nbecause I like the girl very much; but as it is, no one has ever \\ntreated her more courteously than I, with more respect for \\nher dignity … I wait in hopes, that’s all!’\\n‘You had much better make her a present of something.

              " '’\\n‘You don’t understand, as I’ve told you already! Of course, \\nshe is in such a position, but it’s another question. Quite an-\\nother question! You simply despise her. Seeing a fact which \\nyou mistakenly consider deserving of contempt, you re-\\nfuse to take a humane view of a fellow creature. You don’t \\nknow what a character she is! I am only sorry that of late \\nshe has quite given up reading and borrowing books. I used \\nto lend them to her. I am sorry, too, that with all the en-\\nergy and resolution in protesting—which she has already \\nshown once—she has little self-reliance, little, so to say, in-\\ndependence, so as to break free from certain prejudices and \\ncertain foolish ideas. Yet she thoroughly understands some \\n\\uf648\\uf6451\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nquestions, for instance about kissing of hands, that is, that \\nit’s an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her hand, be-\\ncause it’s a sign of inequality. We had a debate about it and \\nI described it to her. She listened attentively to an account \\nof the workmen’s associations in France, too. Now I am ex-\\nplaining the question of coming into the room in the future \\nsociety.’\\n‘And what’s that, pray?’\\n‘We had a debate lately on the question: Has a member of \\nthe community the right to enter another member’s room, \\nwhether man or woman, at any time … and we decided that \\nhe has!’\\n‘It might be at an inconvenient moment, he-he!’\\nLebeziatnikov was really angry.\\n‘You are always thinking of something unpleasant,’ he \\ncried with aversion. ‘Tfoo! How vexed I am that when I was \\nexpounding our system, I referred prematurely to the ques-\\ntion of personal privacy! It’s always a stumbling-block to \\npeople like you, they turn it into ridicule before they under-\\nstand it. And how proud they are of it, too! Tfoo! I’ve often \\nmaintained that that question should not be approached by \\na novice till he has a firm faith in the system. And tell me, \\nplease, what do you find so shameful even in cesspools? I \\nshould be the first to be ready to clean out any cesspool you \\nlike. And it’s not a question of self-sacrifice, it’s simply work, \\nhonourable, useful work which is as good as any other and \\nmuch better than the work of a Raphael and a Pushkin, be-\\ncause it is more useful.’\\n‘And more honourable, more honourable, he-he-he!’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf645\\uf645\\n‘What do you mean by ‘more honourable’?

Everything which is of use to mankind is \\nhonourable. I only understand one word: useful! You can \\nsnigger as much as you like, but that’s so!’\\nPyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily. He had finished \\ncounting the money and was putting it away. But some of \\nthe notes he left on the table. The ‘cesspool question’ had \\nalready been a subject of dispute between them. What was \\nabsurd was that it made Lebeziatnikov really angry, while it \\namused Luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted \\nto anger his young friend.\\n‘It’s your ill-luck yesterday that makes you so ill-hu-\\nmoured and annoying,’ blurted out Lebeziatnikov, who in \\nspite of his ‘independence’ and his ‘protests’ did not venture \\nto oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still behaved to him with \\nsome of the respect habitual in earlier years.\\n‘You’d better tell me this,’ Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted \\nwith haughty displeasure, ‘can you … or rather are you re-\\nally friendly enough with that young person to ask her to \\nstep in here for a minute? I think they’ve all come back from \\nthe cemetery … I heard the sound of steps … I want to see \\nher, that young person.’\\n‘What for?’ Lebeziatnikov asked with surprise.\\n‘Oh, I want to. I am leaving here to-day or to-morrow \\nand therefore I wanted to speak to her about … However, \\nyou may be present during the interview. It’s better you \\nshould be, indeed. For there’s no knowing what you might \\n\\uf648\\uf645\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nimagine.’\\n‘I shan’t imagine anything. I only asked and, if you’ve \\nanything to say to her, nothing is easier than to call her in. \\nI’ll go directly and you may be sure I won’t be in your way.’\\nFive minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia. \\nShe came in very much surprised and overcome with shy-\\nness as usual. She was always shy in such circumstances and \\nwas always afraid of new people, she had been as a child \\nand was even more so now…. Pyotr Petrovitch met her \\n‘politely and affably,’ but with a certain shade of bantering \\nfamiliarity which in his opinion was suitable for a man of \\nhis respectability and weight in dealing with a creature so \\nyoung and so interesting as she.',\n",
              " 'He hastened to ‘reassure’ \\nher and made her sit down facing him at the table. Sonia \\nsat down, looked about her—at Lebeziatnikov, at the notes \\nlying on the table and then again at Pyotr Petrovitch and \\nher eyes remained riveted on him. Lebeziatnikov was mov-\\ning to the door. Pyotr Petrovitch signed to Sonia to remain \\nseated and stopped Lebeziatnikov.\\n‘Is Raskolnikov in there? Has he come?’ he asked him in \\na whisper.\\n‘Raskolnikov? Yes. Why? Yes, he is there. I saw him just \\ncome in…. Why?’\\n‘Well, I particularly beg you to remain here with us and \\nnot to leave me alone with this … young woman. I only want \\na few words with her, but God knows what they may make \\nof it. I shouldn’t like Raskolnikov to repeat anything…. You \\nunderstand what I mean?’\\n‘I understand!’ Lebeziatnikov saw the point. ‘Yes, you are \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf645\\uf647\\nright…. Of course, I am convinced personally that you have \\nno reason to be uneasy, but … still, you are right. Certainly \\nI’ll stay. I’ll stand here at the window and not be in your way \\n… I think you are right …’\\nPyotr Petrovitch returned to the sofa, sat down opposite \\nSonia, looked attentively at her and assumed an extremely \\ndignified, even severe expression, as much as to say, ‘don’t \\nyou make any mistake, madam.’ Sonia was overwhelmed \\nwith embarrassment.\\n‘In the first place, Sofya Semyonovna, will you make my \\nexcuses to your respected mamma…. That’s right, isn’t it? \\nKaterina Ivanovna stands in the place of a mother to you?’ \\nPyotr Petrovitch began with great dignity, though affably.\\nIt was evident that his intentions were friendly.\\n‘Quite so, yes; the place of a mother,’ Sonia answered, \\ntimidly and hurriedly.\\n‘Then will you make my apologies to her? Through inevi-\\ntable circumstances I am forced to be absent and shall not \\nbe at the dinner in spite of your mamma’s kind invitation.’\\n‘Yes … I’ll tell her … at once.’\\nAnd Sonia hastily jumped up from her seat.\\n‘Wait, that’s not all,’ Pyotr Petrovitch detained her, smil-\\ning at her simplicity and ignorance of good manners, ‘and \\nyou know me little, my dear Sofya Semyonovna, if you sup-\\npose I would have ventured to trouble a person like you for a \\nmatter of so little consequence affecting myself only. I have \\nanother object.’\\nSonia sat down hurriedly. Her eyes rested again for an \\ninstant on the grey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that re-\\n\\uf648\\uf645\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nmained on the table, but she quickly looked away and fixed \\nher eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch. She felt it horribly indecorous, \\nespecially for her to look at another person’s money. She \\nstared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held in \\nhis left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome \\nring with a yellow stone on his middle finger. But suddenly \\nshe looked away and, not knowing where to turn, ended by \\nstaring Pyotr Petrovitch again straight in the face. After a \\npause of still greater dignity he continued.\\n‘I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple \\nof words with Katerina Ivanovna, poor woman. That was \\nsufficient to enable me to ascertain that she is in a position—\\npreternatural, if one may so express it.’\\n‘Yes … preternatural …’ Sonia hurriedly assented.\\n‘Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say, \\nill.’\\n‘Yes, simpler and more comprehen … yes, ill.’\\n‘Quite so. So then from a feeling of humanity and so to \\nspeak compassion, I should be glad to be of service to her in \\nany way, foreseeing her unfortunate position.',\n",
              " 'I believe the \\nwhole of this poverty-stricken family depends now entirely \\non you?’\\n‘Allow me to ask,’ Sonia rose to her feet, ‘did you say \\nsomething to her yesterday of the possibility of a pension? \\nBecause she told me you had undertaken to get her one. \\nWas that true?’\\n‘Not in the slightest, and indeed it’s an absurdity! I merely \\nhinted at her obtaining temporary assistance as the widow \\nof an official who had died in the service—if only she has \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf645\\uf649\\npatronage … but apparently your late parent had not served \\nhis full term and had not indeed been in the service at all \\nof late. In fact, if there could be any hope, it would be very \\nephemeral, because there would be no claim for assistance \\nin that case, far from it…. And she is dreaming of a pension \\nalready, he-he-he! … A go-ahead lady!’\\n‘Yes, she is. For she is credulous and good-hearted, and \\nshe believes everything from the goodness of her heart and \\n… and … and she is like that … yes … You must excuse her,’ \\nsaid Sonia, and again she got up to go.\\n‘But you haven’t heard what I have to say.’\\n‘No, I haven’t heard,’ muttered Sonia.\\n‘Then sit down.’ She was terribly confused; she sat down \\nagain a third time.\\n‘Seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones, I \\nshould be glad, as I have said before, so far as lies in my \\npower, to be of service, that is, so far as is in my power, not \\nmore. One might for instance get up a subscription for her, \\nor a lottery, something of the sort, such as is always ar-\\nranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous \\nof assisting people. It was of that I intended to speak to you; \\nit might be done.’\\n‘Yes, yes … God will repay you for it,’ faltered Sonia, gaz-\\ning intently at Pyotr Petrovitch.\\n‘It might be, but we will talk of it later. We might be-\\ngin it to-day, we will talk it over this evening and lay the \\nfoundation so to speak. Come to me at seven o’clock. Mr. \\nLebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us. But there is one cir-\\ncumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and for \\n\\uf648\\uf645\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nwhich I venture to trouble you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come \\nhere. In my opinion money cannot be, indeed it’s unsafe \\nto put it into Katerina Ivanovna’s own hands. The dinner \\nto-day is a proof of that. Though she has not, so to speak, \\na crust of bread for to-morrow and … well, boots or shoes, \\nor anything; she has bought to-day Jamaica rum, and even, \\nI believe, Madeira and … and coffee. I saw it as I passed \\nthrough. To-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they \\nwon’t have a crust of bread. It’s absurd, really, and so, to my \\nthinking, a subscription ought to be raised so that the un-\\nhappy widow should not know of the money, but only you, \\nfor instance. Am I right?’\\n‘I don’t know … this is only to-day, once in her life…. She \\nwas so anxious to do honour, to celebrate the memory…. \\nAnd she is very sensible … but just as you think and I shall \\nbe very, very … they will all be … and God will reward … \\nand the orphans …’\\nSonia burst into tears.\\n‘Very well, then, keep it in mind; and now will you ac-\\ncept for the benefit of your relation the small sum that I am \\nable to spare, from me personally. I am very anxious that \\nmy name should not be mentioned in connection with it. \\nHere … having so to speak anxieties of my own, I cannot \\ndo more …’\\nAnd Pyotr Petrovitch held out to Sonia a ten-rouble note \\ncarefully unfolded. Sonia took it, flushed crimson, jumped \\nup, muttered something and began taking leave. Pyotr \\nPetrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously to the door. \\nShe got out of the room at last, agitated and distressed, and \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf645\\uf64b\\nreturned to Katerina Ivanovna, overwhelmed with confu-\\nsion.\\nAll this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or \\nwalked about the room, anxious not to interrupt the con-\\nversation; when Sonia had gone he walked up to Pyotr \\nPetrovitch and solemnly held out his hand.\\n‘I heard and saw everything,’ he said, laying stress on the \\nlast verb. ‘That is honourable, I mean to say, it’s humane! \\nYou wanted to avoid gratitude, I saw! And although I can-\\nnot, I confess, in principle sympathise with private charity, \\nfor it not only fails to eradicate the evil but even promotes it, \\nyet I must admit that I saw your action with pleasure—yes, \\nyes, I like it.’\\n‘That’s all nonsense,’ muttered Pyotr Petrovitch, some-\\nwhat disconcerted, looking carefully at Lebeziatnikov.\\n‘No, it’s not nonsense! A man who has suffered dis-\\ntress and annoyance as you did yesterday and who yet can \\nsympathise with the misery of others, such a man … even \\nthough he is making a social mistake—is still deserving of \\nrespect! I did not expect it indeed of you, Pyotr Petrovitch, \\nespecially as according to your ideas … oh, what a drawback \\nyour ideas are to you! How distressed you are for instance \\nby your ill-luck yesterday,’ cried the simple-hearted Lebezi-\\natnikov, who felt a return of affection for Pyotr Petrovitch.',\n",
              " '‘And, what do you want with marriage, with legal marriage, \\nmy dear, noble Pyotr Petrovitch? Why do you cling to this \\nlegality of marriage? Well, you may beat me if you like, but I \\nam glad, positively glad it hasn’t come off, that you are free, \\nthat you are not quite lost for humanity…. you see, I’ve spo-\\n\\uf648\\uf645\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nken my mind!’\\n‘Because I don’t want in your free marriage to be made a \\nfool of and to bring up another man’s children, that’s why I \\nwant legal marriage,’ Luzhin replied in order to make some \\nanswer.\\nHe seemed preoccupied by something.\\n‘Children? You referred to children,’ Lebeziatnikov start-\\ned off like a warhorse at the trumpet call. ‘Children are a \\nsocial question and a question of first importance, I agree; \\nbut the question of children has another solution. Some re-\\nfuse to have children altogether, because they suggest the \\ninstitution of the family. We’ll speak of children later, but \\nnow as to the question of honour, I confess that’s my weak \\npoint. That horrid, military, Pushkin expression is un-\\nthinkable in the dictionary of the future. What does it mean \\nindeed? It’s nonsense, there will be no deception in a free \\nmarriage! That is only the natural consequence of a legal \\nmarriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest. So that indeed \\nit’s not humiliating … and if I ever, to suppose an absurdity, \\nwere to be legally married, I should be positively glad of it. \\nI should say to my wife: ‘My dear, hitherto I have loved you, \\nnow I respect you, for you’ve shown you can protest!’ You \\nlaugh! That’s because you are of incapable of getting away \\nfrom prejudices. Confound it all! I understand now where \\nthe unpleasantness is of being deceived in a legal marriage, \\nbut it’s simply a despicable consequence of a despicable po-\\nsition in which both are humiliated. When the deception \\nis open, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it’s un-\\nthinkable. Your wife will only prove how she respects you \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf6460\\nby considering you incapable of opposing her happiness \\nand avenging yourself on her for her new husband. Damn it \\nall! I sometimes dream if I were to be married, pfoo! I mean \\nif I were to marry, legally or not, it’s just the same, I should \\npresent my wife with a lover if she had not found one for \\nherself. ‘My dear,’ I should say, ‘I love you, but even more \\nthan that I desire you to respect me. See!’ Am I not right?’\\nPyotr Petrovitch sniggered as he listened, but without \\nmuch merriment. He hardly heard it indeed. He was pre-\\noccupied with something else and even Lebeziatnikov at \\nlast noticed it. Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excited and rubbed \\nhis hands. Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected \\nupon it afterwards.\\n\\uf648\\uf6461\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter II\\nI\\nt would be difficult to explain exactly what could have \\noriginated the idea of that senseless dinner in Katerina \\nIvanovna’s disordered brain. Nearly ten of the twenty rou-\\nbles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov’s funeral, were \\nwasted upon it. Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to \\nhonour the memory of the deceased ‘suitably,’ that all the \\nlodgers, and still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know ‘that \\nhe was in no way their inferior, and perhaps very much their \\nsuperior,’ and that no one had the right ‘to turn up his nose \\nat him.’ Perhaps the chief element was that peculiar ‘poor \\nman’s pride,’ which compels many poor people to spend \\ntheir last savings on some traditional social ceremony, sim-\\nply in order to do ‘like other people,’ and not to ‘be looked \\ndown upon.’ It is very probable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna \\nlonged on this occasion, at the moment when she seemed \\nto be abandoned by everyone, to show those ‘wretched con-\\ntemptible lodgers’ that she knew ‘how to do things, how to \\nentertain’ and that she had been brought up ‘in a genteel, she \\nmight almost say aristocratic colonel’s family’ and had not \\nbeen meant for sweeping floors and washing the children’s \\nrags at night. Even the poorest and most broken-spirited \\npeople are sometimes liable to these paroxysms of pride \\nand vanity which take the form of an irresistible nervous \\ncraving. And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf646\\uf645\\nshe might have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit \\ncould not have been broken, that is, she could not have been \\nintimidated, her will could not be crushed. Moreover Sonia \\nhad said with good reason that her mind was unhinged. She \\ncould not be said to be insane, but for a year past she had \\nbeen so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained. \\nThe later stages of consumption are apt, doctors tell us, to \\naffect the intellect.\\nThere was no great variety of wines, nor was there Ma-\\ndeira; but wine there was. There was vodka, rum and Lisbon \\nwine, all of the poorest quality but in sufficient quantity. Be-\\nsides the traditional rice and honey, there were three or four \\ndishes, one of which consisted of pancakes, all prepared \\nin Amalia Ivanovna’s kitchen. Two samovars were boiling, \\nthat tea and punch might be offered after dinner. Kateri-\\nna Ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, \\nwith the help of one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little \\nPole who had somehow been stranded at Madame Lippe-\\nvechsel’s. He promptly put himself at Katerina Ivanovna’s \\ndisposal and had been all that morning and all the day be-\\nfore running about as fast as his legs could carry him, and \\nvery anxious that everyone should be aware of it. For ev-\\nery trifle he ran to Katerina Ivanovna, even hunting her out \\nat the bazaar, at every instant called her ‘Pani.',\n",
              " '’ She was \\nheartily sick of him before the end, though she had de-\\nclared at first that she could not have got on without this \\n‘serviceable and magnanimous man.’ It was one of Katerina \\nIvanovna’s characteristics to paint everyone she met in the \\nmost glowing colours. Her praises were so exaggerated as \\n\\uf648\\uf646\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nsometimes to be embarrassing; she would invent various \\ncircumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance and \\nquite genuinely believe in their reality. Then all of a sudden \\nshe would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemp-\\ntuously repulse the person she had only a few hours before \\nbeen literally adoring. She was naturally of a gay, lively and \\npeace-loving disposition, but from continual failures and \\nmisfortunes she had come to desire so keenly that all should \\nlive in peace and joy and should not dare to break the peace, \\nthat the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her al-\\nmost to frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the \\nbrightest hopes and fancies to cursing her fate and raving, \\nand knocking her head against the wall.\\nAmalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary \\nimportance in Katerina Ivanovna’s eyes and was treated \\nby her with extraordinary respect, probably only because \\nAmalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart and soul into the \\npreparations. She had undertaken to lay the table, to pro-\\nvide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her \\nkitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands \\nand gone herself to the cemetery. Everything had been well \\ndone. Even the table-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, \\nknives, forks and glasses were, of course, of all shapes and \\npatterns, lent by different lodgers, but the table was prop-\\nerly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna, feeling she \\nhad done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and \\na cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning \\nparty with some pride. This pride, though justifiable, dis-\\npleased Katerina Ivanovna for some reason: ‘as though the \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf646\\uf647\\ntable could not have been laid except by Amalia Ivanovna!’ \\nShe disliked the cap with new ribbons, too. ‘Could she be \\nstuck up, the stupid German, because she was mistress of \\nthe house, and had consented as a favour to help her poor \\nlodgers! As a favour! Fancy that! Katerina Ivanovna’s father \\nwho had been a colonel and almost a governor had some-\\ntimes had the table set for forty persons, and then anyone \\nlike Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not \\nhave been allowed into the kitchen.’\\nKaterina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feel-\\nings for the time and contented herself with treating her \\ncoldly, though she decided inwardly that she would cer-\\ntainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down and set her in her \\nproper place, for goodness only knew what she was fancying \\nherself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that \\nhardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, \\nexcept the Pole who had just managed to run into the cem-\\netery, while to the memorial dinner the poorest and most \\ninsignificant of them had turned up, the wretched creatures, \\nmany of them not quite sober. The older and more respect-\\nable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away. Pyotr \\nPetrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the \\nmost respectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though \\nKaterina Ivanovna had the evening before told all the world, \\nthat is Amalia Ivanovna, Polenka, Sonia and the Pole, that \\nhe was the most generous, noble-hearted man with a large \\nproperty and vast connections, who had been a friend of \\nher first husband’s, and a guest in her father’s house, and \\nthat he had promised to use all his influence to secure her a \\n\\uf648\\uf646\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nconsiderable pension. It must be noted that when Katerina \\nIvanovna exalted anyone’s connections and fortune, it was \\nwithout any ulterior motive, quite disinterestedly, for the \\nmere pleasure of adding to the consequence of the person \\npraised. Probably ‘taking his cue’ from Luzhin, ‘that con-\\ntemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up either. \\nWhat did he fancy himself? He was only asked out of kind-\\nness and because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr \\nPetrovitch and was a friend of his, so that it would have \\nbeen awkward not to invite him.’\\nAmong those who failed to appear were ‘the genteel lady \\nand her old- maidish daughter,’ who had only been lodg-\\ners in the house for the last fortnight, but had several times \\ncomplained of the noise and uproar in Katerina Ivanovna’s \\nroom, especially when Marmeladov had come back drunk. \\nKaterina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who, \\nquarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn \\nthe whole family out of doors, had shouted at her that they \\n‘were not worth the foot’ of the honourable lodgers whom \\nthey were disturbing. Katerina Ivanovna determined now \\nto invite this lady and her daughter, ‘whose foot she was not \\nworth,’ and who had turned away haughtily when she casu-\\nally met them, so that they might know that ‘she was more \\nnoble in her thoughts and feelings and did not harbour mal-\\nice,’ and might see that she was not accustomed to her way \\nof living. She had proposed to make this clear to them at \\ndinner with allusions to her late father’s governorship, and \\nalso at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly stupid \\nof them to turn away on meeting her. The fat colonel-major \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf646\\uf649\\n(he was really a discharged officer of low rank) was also ab-\\nsent, but it appeared that he had been ‘not himself’ for the \\nlast two days. The party consisted of the Pole, a wretched \\nlooking clerk with a spotty face and a greasy coat, who had \\nnot a word to say for himself, and smelt abominably, a deaf \\nand almost blind old man who had once been in the post of-\\nfice and who had been from immemorial ages maintained \\nby someone at Amalia Ivanovna’s.\\nA retired clerk of the commissariat department came, \\ntoo; he was drunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and \\nonly fancy—was without a waistcoat! One of the visitors sat \\nstraight down to the table without even greeting Katerina \\nIvanovna. Finally one person having no suit appeared in \\nhis dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts \\nof Amalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing \\nhim. The Pole brought with him, however, two other Poles \\nwho did not live at Amalia Ivanovna’s and whom no one \\nhad seen here before. All this irritated Katerina Ivanovna \\nintensely. ‘For whom had they made all these preparations \\nthen?’ To make room for the visitors the children had not \\neven been laid for at the table; but the two little ones were \\nsitting on a bench in the furthest corner with their dinner \\nlaid on a box, while Polenka as a big girl had to look after \\nthem, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like well-bred \\nchildren’s.\\nKaterina Ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting \\nher guests with increased dignity, and even haughtiness. \\nShe stared at some of them with special severity, and loftily \\ninvited them to take their seats. Rushing to the conclusion \\n\\uf648\\uf646\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthat Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who \\nwere absent, she began treating her with extreme noncha-\\nlance, which the latter promptly observed and resented. \\nSuch a beginning was no good omen for the end. All were \\nseated at last.\\nRaskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their re-\\nturn from the cemetery. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly \\ndelighted to see him, in the first place, because he was the \\none ‘educated visitor, and, as everyone knew, was in two \\nyears to take a professorship in the university,’ and sec-\\nondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised \\nfor having been unable to be at the funeral.',\n",
              " 'She positive-\\nly pounced upon him, and made him sit on her left hand \\n(Amalia Ivanovna was on her right). In spite of her continu-\\nal anxiety that the dishes should be passed round correctly \\nand that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonis-\\ning cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed \\nto have grown worse during the last few days, she hastened \\nto pour out in a half whisper to Raskolnikov all her sup-\\npressed feelings and her just indignation at the failure of \\nthe dinner, interspersing her remarks with lively and un-\\ncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and \\nespecially of her landlady.\\n‘It’s all that cuckoo’s fault! You know whom I mean? \\nHer, her!’ Katerina Ivanovna nodded towards the landlady. \\n‘Look at her, she’s making round eyes, she feels that we are \\ntalking about her and can’t understand. Pfoo, the owl! Ha-\\nha! (Cough-cough-cough.) And what does she put on that \\ncap for? (Cough-cough-cough.) Have you noticed that she \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf646\\uf64b\\nwants everyone to consider that she is patronising me and \\ndoing me an honour by being here? I asked her like a sen-\\nsible woman to invite people, especially those who knew my \\nlate husband, and look at the set of fools she has brought! \\nThe sweeps! Look at that one with the spotty face. And \\nthose wretched Poles, ha-ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) \\nNot one of them has ever poked his nose in here, I’ve nev-\\ner set eyes on them. What have they come here for, I ask \\nyou? There they sit in a row. Hey, pan!’ she cried suddenly \\nto one of them, ‘have you tasted the pancakes? Take some \\nmore! Have some beer! Won’t you have some vodka? Look, \\nhe’s jumped up and is making his bows, they must be quite \\nstarved, poor things. Never mind, let them eat! They don’t \\nmake a noise, anyway, though I’m really afraid for our land-\\nlady’s silver spoons … Amalia Ivanovna!’ she addressed her \\nsuddenly, almost aloud, ‘if your spoons should happen to \\nbe stolen, I won’t be responsible, I warn you! Ha-ha-ha!’ \\nShe laughed turning to Raskolnikov, and again nodding \\ntowards the landlady, in high glee at her sally. ‘She didn’t \\nunderstand, she didn’t understand again! Look how she sits \\nwith her mouth open! An owl, a real owl! An owl in new rib-\\nbons, ha-ha-ha!’\\nHere her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of \\ncoughing that lasted five minutes. Drops of perspiration \\nstood out on her forehead and her handkerchief was stained \\nwith blood. She showed Raskolnikov the blood in silence, \\nand as soon as she could get her breath began whispering \\nto him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on \\nher cheeks.\\n\\uf648\\uf646\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘Do you know, I gave her the most delicate instructions, \\nso to speak, for inviting that lady and her daughter, you \\nunderstand of whom I am speaking? It needed the utmost \\ndelicacy, the greatest nicety, but she has managed things so \\nthat that fool, that conceited baggage, that provincial non-\\nentity, simply because she is the widow of a major, and has \\ncome to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in \\nthe government offices, because at fifty she paints her face \\n(everybody knows it) … a creature like that did not think fit \\nto come, and has not even answered the invitation, which \\nthe most ordinary good manners required! I can’t under-\\nstand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come? But where’s \\nSonia? Where has she gone? Ah, there she is at last! what \\nis it, Sonia, where have you been? It’s odd that even at your \\nfather’s funeral you should be so unpunctual. Rodion Ro-\\nmanovitch, make room for her beside you. That’s your place, \\nSonia … take what you like. Have some of the cold entrée \\nwith jelly, that’s the best. They’ll bring the pancakes direct-\\nly. Have they given the children some? Polenka, have you \\ngot everything? (Cough-cough-cough.) That’s all right. Be \\na good girl, Lida, and, Kolya, don’t fidget with your feet; sit \\nlike a little gentleman. What are you saying, Sonia?’\\nSonia hastened to give her Pyotr Petrovitch’s apolo-\\ngies, trying to speak loud enough for everyone to hear and \\ncarefully choosing the most respectful phrases which she \\nattributed to Pyotr Petrovitch. She added that Pyotr Petro-\\nvitch had particularly told her to say that, as soon as he \\npossibly could, he would come immediately to discuss busi-\\nness alone with her and to consider what could be done for \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf6470\\nher, etc., etc.\\nSonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna, \\nwould flatter her and gratify her pride. She sat down be-\\nside Raskolnikov; she made him a hurried bow, glancing \\ncuriously at him. But for the rest of the time she seemed to \\navoid looking at him or speaking to him. She seemed ab-\\nsent-minded, though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, \\ntrying to please her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had \\nbeen able to get mourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown, \\nand Katerina Ivanovna had on her only dress, a dark striped \\ncotton one.\\nThe message from Pyotr Petrovitch was very successful. \\nListening to Sonia with dignity, Katerina Ivanovna inquired \\nwith equal dignity how Pyotr Petrovitch was, then at once \\nwhispered almost aloud to Raskolnikov that it certainly \\nwould have been strange for a man of Pyotr Petrovitch’s po-\\nsition and standing to find himself in such ‘extraordinary \\ncompany,’ in spite of his devotion to her family and his old \\nfriendship with her father.\\n‘That’s why I am so grateful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, \\nthat you have not disdained my hospitality, even in such \\nsurroundings,’ she added almost aloud. ‘But I am sure that \\nit was only your special affection for my poor husband that \\nhas made you keep your promise.’\\nThen once more with pride and dignity she scanned her \\nvisitors, and suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the \\ndeaf man: ‘Wouldn’t he have some more meat, and had he \\nbeen given some wine?’ The old man made no answer and \\nfor a long while could not understand what he was asked, \\n\\uf648\\uf6471\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthough his neighbours amused themselves by poking and \\nshaking him. He simply gazed about him with his mouth \\nopen, which only increased the general mirth.\\n‘What an imbecile! Look, look! Why was he brought? \\nBut as to Pyotr Petrovitch, I always had confidence in him,’ \\nKaterina Ivanovna continued, ‘and, of course, he is not \\nlike …’ with an extremely stern face she addressed Amalia \\nIvanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter was quite dis-\\nconcerted, ‘not like your dressed up draggletails whom my \\nfather would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen, and \\nmy late husband would have done them honour if he had \\ninvited them in the goodness of his heart.',\n",
              " '’\\n‘Yes, he was fond of drink, he was fond of it, he did drink!’ \\ncried the commissariat clerk, gulping down his twelfth \\nglass of vodka.\\n‘My late husband certainly had that weakness, and every-\\none knows it,’ Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once, ‘but \\nhe was a kind and honourable man, who loved and respect-\\ned his family. The worst of it was his good nature made him \\ntrust all sorts of disreputable people, and he drank with fel-\\nlows who were not worth the sole of his shoe. Would you \\nbelieve it, Rodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread \\ncock in his pocket; he was dead drunk, but he did not forget \\nthe children!’\\n‘A cock? Did you say a cock?’ shouted the commissariat \\nclerk.\\nKaterina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply. She sighed, \\nlost in thought.\\n‘No doubt you think, like everyone, that I was too se-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf647\\uf645\\nvere with him,’ she went on, addressing Raskolnikov. ‘But \\nthat’s not so! He respected me, he respected me very much! \\nHe was a kind-hearted man! And how sorry I was for him \\nsometimes! He would sit in a corner and look at me, I used \\nto feel so sorry for him, I used to want to be kind to him \\nand then would think to myself: ‘Be kind to him and he will \\ndrink again,’ it was only by severity that you could keep him \\nwithin bounds.’\\n‘Yes, he used to get his hair pulled pretty often,’ roared \\nthe commissariat clerk again, swallowing another glass of \\nvodka.\\n‘Some fools would be the better for a good drubbing, as \\nwell as having their hair pulled. I am not talking of my late \\nhusband now!’ Katerina Ivanovna snapped at him.\\nThe flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked, her \\nchest heaved. In another minute she would have been ready \\nto make a scene. Many of the visitors were sniggering, evi-\\ndently delighted. They began poking the commissariat clerk \\nand whispering something to him. They were evidently try-\\ning to egg him on.\\n‘Allow me to ask what are you alluding to,’ began the \\nclerk, ‘that is to say, whose … about whom … did you say \\njust now … But I don’t care! That’s nonsense! Widow! I for-\\ngive you…. Pass!’\\nAnd he took another drink of vodka.\\nRaskolnikov sat in silence, listening with disgust. He only \\nate from politeness, just tasting the food that Katerina Iva-\\nnovna was continually putting on his plate, to avoid hurting \\nher feelings. He watched Sonia intently. But Sonia became \\n\\uf648\\uf647\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nmore and more anxious and distressed; she, too, foresaw \\nthat the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with ter-\\nror Katerina Ivanovna’s growing irritation. She knew that \\nshe, Sonia, was the chief reason for the ‘genteel’ ladies’ con-\\ntemptuous treatment of Katerina Ivanovna’s invitation. She \\nhad heard from Amalia Ivanovna that the mother was posi-\\ntively offended at the invitation and had asked the question: \\n‘How could she let her daughter sit down beside that young \\nperson?’ Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had \\nalready heard this and an insult to Sonia meant more to \\nKaterina Ivanovna than an insult to herself, her children, or \\nher father, Sonia knew that Katerina Ivanovna would not \\nbe satisfied now, ‘till she had shown those draggletails that \\nthey were both …’ To make matters worse someone passed \\nSonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two \\nhearts pierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread. Kateri-\\nna Ivanovna flushed crimson and at once said aloud across \\nthe table that the man who sent it was ‘a drunken ass!’\\nAmalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and \\nat the same time deeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna’s \\nhaughtiness, and to restore the good-humour of the com-\\npany and raise herself in their esteem she began, apropos of \\nnothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers ‘Karl \\nfrom the chemist’s,’ who was driving one night in a cab, and \\nthat ‘the cabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much \\nbegged him not to kill, and wept and clasped hands, and \\nfrightened and from fear pierced his heart.’ Though Kat-\\nerina Ivanovna smiled, she observed at once that Amalia \\nIvanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf647\\uf647\\nwas still more offended, and she retorted that her ‘Vater aus \\nBerlin was a very important man, and always went with his \\nhands in pockets.’ Katerina Ivanovna could not restrain \\nherself and laughed so much that Amalia Ivanovna lost pa-\\ntience and could scarcely control herself.\\n‘Listen to the owl!’ Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once, \\nher good- humour almost restored, ‘she meant to say he \\nkept his hands in his pockets, but she said he put his hands \\nin people’s pockets. (Cough- cough.) And have you noticed, \\nRodion Romanovitch, that all these Petersburg foreign-\\ners, the Germans especially, are all stupider than we! Can \\nyou fancy anyone of us telling how ‘Karl from the chemist’s’ \\n‘pierced his heart from fear’ and that the idiot, instead of \\npunishing the cabman, ‘clasped his hands and wept, and \\nmuch begged.’ Ah, the fool! And you know she fancies it’s \\nvery touching and does not suspect how stupid she is! To my \\nthinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great deal \\ncleverer, anyway one can see that he has addled his brains \\nwith drink, but you know, these foreigners are always so \\nwell behaved and serious…. Look how she sits glaring! She \\nis angry, ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.)’\\nRegaining her good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna began \\nat once telling Raskolnikov that when she had obtained her \\npension, she intended to open a school for the daughters \\nof gentlemen in her native town T——. This was the first \\ntime she had spoken to him of the project, and she launched \\nout into the most alluring details. It suddenly appeared that \\nKaterina Ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of \\nhonour of which Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov \\n\\uf648\\uf647\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nin the tavern, when he told him that Katerina Ivanovna, his \\nwife, had danced the shawl dance before the governor and \\nother great personages on leaving school. This certificate of \\nhonour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina Iva-\\nnovna’s right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed \\nherself with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming \\n‘those two stuck-up draggletails’ if they came to the din-\\nner, and proving incontestably that Katerina Ivanovna was \\nof the most noble, ‘she might even say aristocratic family, a \\ncolonel’s daughter and was far superior to certain adven-\\nturesses who have been so much to the fore of late.’ The \\ncertificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of \\nthe drunken guests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to \\nretain it, for it actually contained the statement en toutes \\nlettres that her father was of the rank of a major, and also \\na companion of an order, so that she really was almost the \\ndaughter of a colonel.\\nWarming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge \\non the peaceful and happy life they would lead in T——, \\non the gymnasium teachers whom she would engage to \\ngive lessons in her boarding-school, one a most respect-\\nable old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina \\nIvanovna herself in old days and was still living in T——, \\nand would no doubt teach in her school on moderate terms.',\n",
              " 'Next she spoke of Sonia who would go with her to T—— \\nand help her in all her plans. At this someone at the further \\nend of the table gave a sudden guffaw.\\nThough Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdain-\\nfully unaware of it, she raised her voice and began at once \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf647\\uf649\\nspeaking with conviction of Sonia’s undoubted ability to \\nassist her, of ‘her gentleness, patience, devotion, generosity \\nand good education,’ tapping Sonia on the cheek and kiss-\\ning her warmly twice. Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina \\nIvanovna suddenly burst into tears, immediately observing \\nthat she was ‘nervous and silly, that she was too much upset, \\nthat it was time to finish, and as the dinner was over, it was \\ntime to hand round the tea.’\\nAt that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at \\ntaking no part in the conversation, and not being listened \\nto, made one last effort, and with secret misgivings ven-\\ntured on an exceedingly deep and weighty observation, that \\n‘in the future boarding-school she would have to pay partic-\\nular attention to die Wäsche and that there certainly must \\nbe a good dame to look after the linen, and secondly that \\nthe young ladies must not novels at night read.’\\nKaterina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very \\ntired, as well as heartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short \\nAmalia Ivanovna, saying ‘she knew nothing about it and \\nwas talking nonsense, that it was the business of the laundry \\nmaid, and not of the directress of a high- class boarding-\\nschool to look after die Wäsche and as for novel- reading, \\nthat was simply rudeness, and she begged her to be silent.’ \\nAmalia Ivanovna fired up and getting angry observed that \\nshe only ‘meant her good,’ and that ‘she had meant her very \\ngood,’ and that ‘it was long since she had paid her gold for \\nthe lodgings.’\\nKaterina Ivanovna at once ‘set her down,’ saying that it \\nwas a lie to say she wished her good, because only yester-\\n\\uf648\\uf647\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nday when her dead husband was lying on the table, she had \\nworried her about the lodgings. To this Amalia Ivanovna \\nvery appropriately observed that she had invited those la-\\ndies, but ‘those ladies had not come, because those ladies \\nare ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady.’ Kat-\\nerina Ivanovna at once pointed out to her, that as she was a \\nslut she could not judge what made one really a lady. Amalia \\nIvanovna at once declared that her ‘Vater aus Berlin was a \\nvery, very important man, and both hands in pockets went, \\nand always used to say: ‘Poof! poof!’’ and she leapt up from \\nthe table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her \\npockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds \\nresembling ‘poof! poof!’ amid loud laughter from all the \\nlodgers, who purposely encouraged Amalia Ivanovna, hop-\\ning for a fight.\\nBut this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at \\nonce declared, so that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanov-\\nna probably never had a father, but was simply a drunken \\nPetersburg Finn, and had certainly once been a cook and \\nprobably something worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned as red \\nas a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna \\nnever had a father, ‘but she had a Vater aus Berlin and that \\nhe wore a long coat and always said poof-poof-poof!’\\nKaterina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all \\nknew what her family was and that on that very certificate \\nof honour it was stated in print that her father was a colonel, \\nwhile Amalia Ivanovna’s father—if she really had one—was \\nprobably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she \\nnever had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf647\\uf64b\\nher name was Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna.\\nAt this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the \\ntable with her fist, and shrieked that she was Amalia Iva-\\nnovna, and not Ludwigovna, ‘that her Vater was named \\nJohann and that he was a burgomeister, and that Katerina \\nIvanovna’s Vater was quite never a burgomeister.’ Katerina \\nIvanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and appar-\\nently calm voice (though she was pale and her chest was \\nheaving) observed that ‘if she dared for one moment to set \\nher contemptible wretch of a father on a level with her papa, \\nshe, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off her head \\nand trample it under foot.’ Amalia Ivanovna ran about the \\nroom, shouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress \\nof the house and that Katerina Ivanovna should leave the \\nlodgings that minute; then she rushed for some reason to \\ncollect the silver spoons from the table. There was a great \\noutcry and uproar, the children began crying. Sonia ran \\nto restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna \\nshouted something about ‘the yellow ticket,’ Katerina Iva-\\nnovna pushed Sonia away, and rushed at the landlady to \\ncarry out her threat.\\nAt that minute the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch \\nLuzhin appeared on the threshold. He stood scanning the \\nparty with severe and vigilant eyes. Katerina Ivanovna \\nrushed to him.\\n\\uf648\\uf647\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter III\\n‘\\nPyotr Petrovitch,’ she cried, ‘protect me … you at least! \\nMake this foolish woman understand that she can’t be-\\nhave like this to a lady in misfortune … that there is a law \\nfor such things…. I’ll go to the governor-general himself…. \\nShe shall answer for it…. Remembering my father’s hospi-\\ntality protect these orphans.’\\n‘Allow me, madam…. Allow me.’ Pyotr Petrovitch waved \\nher off. ‘Your papa as you are well aware I had not the hon-\\nour of knowing’ (someone laughed aloud) ‘and I do not \\nintend to take part in your everlasting squabbles with Ama-\\nlia Ivanovna…. I have come here to speak of my own affairs \\n… and I want to have a word with your stepdaughter, Sofya \\n… Ivanovna, I think it is? Allow me to pass.’\\nPyotr Petrovitch, edging by her, went to the opposite \\ncorner where Sonia was.\\nKaterina Ivanovna remained standing where she was, \\nas though thunderstruck. She could not understand how \\nPyotr Petrovitch could deny having enjoyed her father’s \\nhospitility. Though she had invented it herself, she believed \\nin it firmly by this time. She was struck too by the business-\\nlike, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr \\nPetrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away at his en-\\ntrance. Not only was this ‘serious business man’ strikingly \\nincongruous with the rest of the party, but it was evident, \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf6480\\ntoo, that he had come upon some matter of consequence, \\nthat some exceptional cause must have brought him and \\nthat therefore something was going to happen. Raskolnikov, \\nstanding beside Sonia, moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr \\nPetrovitch did not seem to notice him.',\n",
              " 'A minute later Lebe-\\nziatnikov, too, appeared in the doorway; he did not come in, \\nbut stood still, listening with marked interest, almost won-\\nder, and seemed for a time perplexed.\\n‘Excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it’s a matter \\nof some importance,’ Pyotr Petrovitch observed, address-\\ning the company generally. ‘I am glad indeed to find other \\npersons present. Amalia Ivanovna, I humbly beg you as \\nmistress of the house to pay careful attention to what I have \\nto say to Sofya Ivanovna. Sofya Ivanovna,’ he went on, ad-\\ndressing Sonia, who was very much surprised and already \\nalarmed, ‘immediately after your visit I found that a hun-\\ndred-rouble note was missing from my table, in the room \\nof my friend Mr. Lebeziatnikov. If in any way whatever you \\nknow and will tell us where it is now, I assure you on my \\nword of honour and call all present to witness that the mat-\\nter shall end there. In the opposite case I shall be compelled \\nto have recourse to very serious measures and then … you \\nmust blame yourself.’\\nComplete silence reigned in the room. Even the cry-\\ning children were still. Sonia stood deadly pale, staring at \\nLuzhin and unable to say a word. She seemed not to under-\\nstand. Some seconds passed.\\n‘Well, how is it to be then?’ asked Luzhin, looking intent-\\nly at her.\\n\\uf648\\uf6481\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘I don’t know…. I know nothing about it,’ Sonia articu-\\nlated faintly at last.\\n‘No, you know nothing?’ Luzhin repeated and again he \\npaused for some seconds. ‘Think a moment, mademoiselle,’ \\nhe began severely, but still, as it were, admonishing her. \\n‘Reflect, I am prepared to give you time for consideration. \\nKindly observe this: if I were not so entirely convinced I \\nshould not, you may be sure, with my experience venture \\nto accuse you so directly. Seeing that for such direct accu-\\nsation before witnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should \\nmyself in a certain sense be made responsible, I am aware \\nof that. This morning I changed for my own purposes sev-\\neral five-per-cent securities for the sum of approximately \\nthree thousand roubles. The account is noted down in my \\npocket-book. On my return home I proceeded to count the \\nmoney—as Mr. Lebeziatnikov will bear witness—and after \\ncounting two thousand three hundred roubles I put the rest \\nin my pocket-book in my coat pocket. About five hundred \\nroubles remained on the table and among them three notes \\nof a hundred roubles each. At that moment you entered (at \\nmy invitation)—and all the time you were present you were \\nexceedingly embarrassed; so that three times you jumped \\nup in the middle of the conversation and tried to make off. \\nMr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness to this. You yourself, \\nmademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm my state-\\nment that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely \\nin order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute po-\\nsition of your relative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner \\nI was unable to attend), and the advisability of getting up \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf648\\uf645\\nsomething of the nature of a subscription, lottery or the \\nlike, for her benefit. You thanked me and even shed tears. \\nI describe all this as it took place, primarily to recall it to \\nyour mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest \\ndetail has escaped my recollection. Then I took a ten- rou-\\nble note from the table and handed it to you by way of first \\ninstalment on my part for the benefit of your relative. Mr. \\nLebeziatnikov saw all this. Then I accompanied you to the \\ndoor—you being still in the same state of embarrassment—\\nafter which, being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov I talked \\nto him for ten minutes— then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out \\nand I returned to the table with the money lying on it, in-\\ntending to count it and to put it aside, as I proposed doing \\nbefore.',\n",
              " 'To my surprise one hundred-rouble note had disap-\\npeared. Kindly consider the position. Mr. Lebeziatnikov I \\ncannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to such a suppo-\\nsition. I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for \\nthe minute before your entrance I had finished my accounts \\nand found the total correct. You will admit that recollect-\\ning your embarrassment, your eagerness to get away and \\nthe fact that you kept your hands for some time on the table, \\nand taking into consideration your social position and the \\nhabits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror and \\npositively against my will, compelled to entertain a suspi-\\ncion—a cruel, but justifiable suspicion! I will add further \\nand repeat that in spite of my positive conviction, I realise \\nthat I run a certain risk in making this accusation, but as \\nyou see, I could not let it pass. I have taken action and I will \\ntell you why: solely, madam, solely, owing to your black in-\\n\\uf648\\uf648\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ngratitude! Why! I invite you for the benefit of your destitute \\nrelative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles and \\nyou, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action. It \\nis too bad! You need a lesson. Reflect! Moreover, like a true \\nfriend I beg you— and you could have no better friend at \\nthis moment—think what you are doing, otherwise I shall \\nbe immovable! Well, what do you say?’\\n‘I have taken nothing,’ Sonia whispered in terror, ‘you \\ngave me ten roubles, here it is, take it.’\\nSonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket, untied \\na corner of it, took out the ten-rouble note and gave it to \\nLuzhin.\\n‘And the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking?’ \\nhe insisted reproachfully, not taking the note.\\nSonia looked about her. All were looking at her with such \\nawful, stern, ironical, hostile eyes. She looked at Raskol-\\nnikov … he stood against the wall, with his arms crossed, \\nlooking at her with glowing eyes.\\n‘Good God!’ broke from Sonia.\\n‘Amalia Ivanovna, we shall have to send word to the po-\\nlice and therefore I humbly beg you meanwhile to send for \\nthe house porter,’ Luzhin said softly and even kindly.\\n‘Gott der Barmherzige! I knew she was the thief,’ cried \\nAmalia Ivanovna, throwing up her hands.\\n‘You knew it?’ Luzhin caught her up, ‘then I suppose you \\nhad some reason before this for thinking so. I beg you, wor-\\nthy Amalia Ivanovna, to remember your words which have \\nbeen uttered before witnesses.’\\nThere was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides. All \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf648\\uf647\\nwere in movement.\\n‘What!’ cried Katerina Ivanovna, suddenly realising the \\nposition, and she rushed at Luzhin. ‘What! You accuse her \\nof stealing? Sonia? Ah, the wretches, the wretches!’\\nAnd running to Sonia she flung her wasted arms round \\nher and held her as in a vise.\\n‘Sonia! how dared you take ten roubles from him? Foolish \\ngirl! Give it to me! Give me the ten roubles at once—here!\\nAnd snatching the note from Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna \\ncrumpled it up and flung it straight into Luzhin’s face. It \\nhit him in the eye and fell on the ground. Amalia Ivanovna \\nhastened to pick it up. Pyotr Petrovitch lost his temper.\\n‘Hold that mad woman!’ he shouted.\\nAt that moment several other persons, besides Lebezi-\\natnikov, appeared in the doorway, among them the two \\nladies.\\n‘What! Mad? Am I mad? Idiot!’ shrieked Katerina Iva-\\nnovna. ‘You are an idiot yourself, pettifogging lawyer, base \\nman! Sonia, Sonia take his money! Sonia a thief! Why, she’d \\ngive away her last penny!’ and Katerina Ivanovna broke \\ninto hysterical laughter. ‘Did you ever see such an idiot?’ \\nshe turned from side to side. ‘And you too?’ she suddenly \\nsaw the landlady, ‘and you too, sausage eater, you declare \\nthat she is a thief, you trashy Prussian hen’s leg in a crino-\\nline! She hasn’t been out of this room: she came straight \\nfrom you, you wretch, and sat down beside me, everyone \\nsaw her. She sat here, by Rodion Romanovitch. Search her! \\nSince she’s not left the room, the money would have to be \\non her! Search her, search her! But if you don’t find it, then \\n\\uf648\\uf648\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nexcuse me, my dear fellow, you’ll answer for it! I’ll go to \\nour Sovereign, to our Sovereign, to our gracious Tsar him-\\nself, and throw myself at his feet, to-day, this minute! I am \\nalone in the world! They would let me in! Do you think they \\nwouldn’t? You’re wrong, I will get in! I will get in! You reck-\\noned on her meekness! You relied upon that! But I am not \\nso submissive, let me tell you! You’ve gone too far yourself. \\nSearch her, search her!’\\nAnd Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and \\ndragged him towards Sonia.\\n‘I am ready, I’ll be responsible … but calm yourself, mad-\\nam, calm yourself.',\n",
              " 'I see that you are not so submissive! … \\nWell, well, but as to that …’ Luzhin muttered, ‘that ought to \\nbe before the police … though indeed there are witnesses \\nenough as it is…. I am ready…. But in any case it’s difficult \\nfor a man … on account of her sex…. But with the help of \\nAmalia Ivanovna … though, of course, it’s not the way to do \\nthings…. How is it to be done?’\\n‘As you will! Let anyone who likes search her!’ cried Kat-\\nerina Ivanovna. ‘Sonia, turn out your pockets! See! Look, \\nmonster, the pocket is empty, here was her handkerchief! \\nHere is the other pocket, look! D’you see, d’you see?’\\nAnd Katerina Ivanovna turned—or rather snatched—\\nboth pockets inside out. But from the right pocket a piece \\nof paper flew out and describing a parabola in the air fell \\nat Luzhin’s feet. Everyone saw it, several cried out. Pyotr \\nPetrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two fin-\\ngers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it. It was a \\nhundred-rouble note folded in eight. Pyotr Petrovitch held \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf648\\uf649\\nup the note showing it to everyone.\\n‘Thief! Out of my lodging. Police, police!’ yelled Amalia \\nIvanovna. ‘They must to Siberia be sent! Away!’\\nExclamations arose on all sides. Raskolnikov was silent, \\nkeeping his eyes fixed on Sonia, except for an occasional \\nrapid glance at Luzhin. Sonia stood still, as though uncon-\\nscious. She was hardly able to feel surprise. Suddenly the \\ncolour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry and hid her \\nface in her hands.\\n‘No, it wasn’t I! I didn’t take it! I know nothing about it,’ \\nshe cried with a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina \\nIvanovna, who clasped her tightly in her arms, as though \\nshe would shelter her from all the world.\\n‘Sonia! Sonia! I don’t believe it! You see, I don’t believe it!’ \\nshe cried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and \\nfro in her arms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then \\nsnatching at her hands and kissing them, too, ‘you took it! \\nHow stupid these people are! Oh dear! You are fools, fools,’ \\nshe cried, addressing the whole room, ‘you don’t know, you \\ndon’t know what a heart she has, what a girl she is! She take \\nit, she? She’d sell her last rag, she’d go barefoot to help you \\nif you needed it, that’s what she is! She has the yellow pass-\\nport because my children were starving, she sold herself for \\nus! Ah, husband, husband! Do you see? Do you see? What \\na memorial dinner for you! Merciful heavens! Defend her, \\nwhy are you all standing still? Rodion Romanovitch, why \\ndon’t you stand up for her? Do you believe it, too? You are \\nnot worth her little finger, all of you together! Good God! \\nDefend her now, at least!’\\n\\uf648\\uf648\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nThe wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman \\nseemed to produce a great effect on her audience. The ago-\\nnised, wasted, consumptive face, the parched blood-stained \\nlips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrained as a child’s, the \\ntrustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help were so \\npiteous that everyone seemed to feel for her. Pyotr Petro-\\nvitch at any rate was at once moved to compassion.\\n‘Madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you!’ \\nhe cried impressively, ‘no one would take upon himself to \\naccuse you of being an instigator or even an accomplice in \\nit, especially as you have proved her guilt by turning out \\nher pockets, showing that you had no previous idea of it. I \\nam most ready, most ready to show compassion, if pover-\\nty, so to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did \\nyou refuse to confess, mademoiselle? Were you afraid of the \\ndisgrace? The first step? You lost your head, perhaps? One \\ncan quite understand it…. But how could you have lowered \\nyourself to such an action? Gentlemen,’ he addressed the \\nwhole company, ‘gentlemen! Compassionate and, so to say, \\ncommiserating these people, I am ready to overlook it even \\nnow in spite of the personal insult lavished upon me! And \\nmay this disgrace be a lesson to you for the future,’ he said, \\naddressing Sonia, ‘and I will carry the matter no further. \\nEnough!’\\nPyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov. Their eyes \\nmet, and the fire in Raskolnikov’s seemed ready to reduce \\nhim to ashes. Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna apparently \\nheard nothing. She was kissing and hugging Sonia like a \\nmadwoman. The children, too, were embracing Sonia on all \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf648\\uf64b\\nsides, and Polenka—though she did not fully understand \\nwhat was wrong—was drowned in tears and shaking with \\nsobs, as she hid her pretty little face, swollen with weeping, \\non Sonia’s shoulder.\\n‘How vile!’ a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.\\nPyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly.\\n‘What vileness!’ Lebeziatnikov repeated, staring him \\nstraight in the face.\\nPyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start—all noticed it and \\nrecalled it afterwards. Lebeziatnikov strode into the room.\\n‘And you dared to call me as witness?’ he said, going up \\nto Pyotr Petrovitch.\\n‘What do you mean? What are you talking about?’ mut-\\ntered Luzhin.\\n‘I mean that you … are a slanderer, that’s what my words \\nmean!’ Lebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him \\nwith his short- sighted eyes.\\nHe was extremely angry.',\n",
              " 'Raskolnikov gazed intently \\nat him, as though seizing and weighing each word. Again \\nthere was a silence. Pyotr Petrovitch indeed seemed almost \\ndumbfounded for the first moment.\\n‘If you mean that for me, …’ he began, stammering. ‘But \\nwhat’s the matter with you? Are you out of your mind?’\\n‘I’m in my mind, but you are a scoundrel! Ah, how vile! \\nI have heard everything. I kept waiting on purpose to un-\\nderstand it, for I must own even now it is not quite logical…. \\nWhat you have done it all for I can’t understand.’\\n‘Why, what have I done then? Give over talking in your \\nnonsensical riddles! Or maybe you are drunk!’\\n\\uf648\\uf648\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘You may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but I am not! \\nI never touch vodka, for it’s against my convictions. Would \\nyou believe it, he, he himself, with his own hands gave So-\\nfya Semyonovna that hundred-rouble note—I saw it, I was \\na witness, I’ll take my oath! He did it, he!’ repeated Lebezi-\\natnikov, addressing all.\\n‘Are you crazy, milksop?’ squealed Luzhin. ‘She is her-\\nself before you —she herself here declared just now before \\neveryone that I gave her only ten roubles. How could I have \\ngiven it to her?’\\n‘I saw it, I saw it,’ Lebeziatnikov repeated, ‘and though \\nit is against my principles, I am ready this very minute to \\ntake any oath you like before the court, for I saw how you \\nslipped it in her pocket. Only like a fool I thought you did \\nit out of kindness! When you were saying good-bye to her \\nat the door, while you held her hand in one hand, with the \\nother, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket. I saw it, \\nI saw it!’\\nLuzhin turned pale.\\n‘What lies!’ he cried impudently, ‘why, how could you, \\nstanding by the window, see the note? You fancied it with \\nyour short-sighted eyes. You are raving!’\\n‘No, I didn’t fancy it. And though I was standing some \\nway off, I saw it all. And though it certainly would be hard \\nto distinguish a note from the window—that’s true—I knew \\nfor certain that it was a hundred-rouble note, because, when \\nyou were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles, you \\ntook up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it be-\\ncause I was standing near then, and an idea struck me at \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf6490\\nonce, so that I did not forget you had it in your hand). You \\nfolded it and kept it in your hand all the time. I didn’t think \\nof it again until, when you were getting up, you changed it \\nfrom your right hand to your left and nearly dropped it! I \\nnoticed it because the same idea struck me again, that you \\nmeant to do her a kindness without my seeing. You can \\nfancy how I watched you and I saw how you succeeded in \\nslipping it into her pocket. I saw it, I saw it, I’ll take my \\noath.’\\nLebeziatnikov was almost breathless. Exclamations arose \\non all hands chiefly expressive of wonder, but some were \\nmenacing in tone. They all crowded round Pyotr Petrovitch. \\nKaterina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov.\\n‘I was mistaken in you! Protect her! You are the only one \\nto take her part! She is an orphan. God has sent you!’\\nKaterina Ivanovna, hardly knowing what she was doing, \\nsank on her knees before him.\\n‘A pack of nonsense!’ yelled Luzhin, roused to fury, ‘it’s \\nall nonsense you’ve been talking! ‘An idea struck you, you \\ndidn’t think, you noticed’—what does it amount to? So I \\ngave it to her on the sly on purpose? What for? With what \\nobject? What have I to do with this …?’\\n‘What for? That’s what I can’t understand, but that what \\nI am telling you is the fact, that’s certain! So far from my \\nbeing mistaken, you infamous criminal man, I remember \\nhow, on account of it, a question occurred to me at once, \\njust when I was thanking you and pressing your hand. \\nWhat made you put it secretly in her pocket? Why you did \\nit secretly, I mean? Could it be simply to conceal it from \\n\\uf648\\uf6491\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nme, knowing that my convictions are opposed to yours \\nand that I do not approve of private benevolence, which ef-\\nfects no radical cure? Well, I decided that you really were \\nashamed of giving such a large sum before me. Perhaps, \\ntoo, I thought, he wants to give her a surprise, when she \\nfinds a whole hundred-rouble note in her pocket. (For I \\nknow, some benevolent people are very fond of decking out \\ntheir charitable actions in that way.) Then the idea struck \\nme, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether, when \\nshe found it, she would come to thank you. Then, too, that \\nyou wanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your \\nright hand should not know … something of that sort, in \\nfact. I thought of so many possibilities that I put off con-\\nsidering it, but still thought it indelicate to show you that \\nI knew your secret. But another idea struck me again that \\nSofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she \\nnoticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call \\nher out of the room and to tell her that you put a hundred \\nroubles in her pocket. But on my way I went first to Ma-\\ndame Kobilatnikov’s to take them the ‘General Treatise on \\nthe Positive Method’ and especially to recommend Piderit’s \\narticle (and also Wagner’s); then I come on here and what \\na state of things I find! Now could I, could I, have all these \\nideas and reflections if I had not seen you put the hundred-\\nrouble note in her pocket?’\\nWhen Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue \\nwith the logical deduction at the end, he was quite tired, \\nand the perspiration streamed from his face. He could not, \\nalas, even express himself correctly in Russian, though he \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf649\\uf645\\nknew no other language, so that he was quite exhausted, \\nalmost emaciated after this heroic exploit.',\n",
              " 'But his speech \\nproduced a powerful effect. He had spoken with such ve-\\nhemence, with such conviction that everyone obviously \\nbelieved him. Pyotr Petrovitch felt that things were going \\nbadly with him.\\n‘What is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you?’ \\nhe shouted, ‘that’s no evidence. You may have dreamt it, \\nthat’s all! And I tell you, you are lying, sir. You are lying and \\nslandering from some spite against me, simply from pique, \\nbecause I did not agree with your free-thinking, godless, \\nsocial propositions!’\\nBut this retort did not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch. Mur-\\nmurs of disapproval were heard on all sides.\\n‘Ah, that’s your line now, is it!’ cried Lebeziatnikov, ‘that’s \\nnonsense! Call the police and I’ll take my oath! There’s only \\none thing I can’t understand: what made him risk such a \\ncontemptible action. Oh, pitiful, despicable man!’\\n‘I can explain why he risked such an action, and if nec-\\nessary, I, too, will swear to it,’ Raskolnikov said at last in a \\nfirm voice, and he stepped forward.\\nHe appeared to be firm and composed. Everyone felt \\nclearly, from the very look of him that he really knew about \\nit and that the mystery would be solved.\\n‘Now I can explain it all to myself,’ said Raskolnikov, ad-\\ndressing Lebeziatnikov. ‘From the very beginning of the \\nbusiness, I suspected that there was some scoundrelly in-\\ntrigue at the bottom of it. I began to suspect it from some \\nspecial circumstances known to me only, which I will ex-\\n\\uf648\\uf649\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nplain at once to everyone: they account for everything. Your \\nvaluable evidence has finally made everything clear to me. I \\nbeg all, all to listen. This gentleman (he pointed to Luzhin) \\nwas recently engaged to be married to a young lady—my \\nsister, Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikov. But coming to \\nPetersburg he quarrelled with me, the day before yesterday, \\nat our first meeting and I drove him out of my room —I \\nhave two witnesses to prove it. He is a very spiteful man…. \\nThe day before yesterday I did not know that he was stay-\\ning here, in your room, and that consequently on the very \\nday we quarrelled—the day before yesterday—he saw me \\ngive Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral, as a \\nfriend of the late Mr. Marmeladov. He at once wrote a note \\nto my mother and informed her that I had given away all my \\nmoney, not to Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, \\nand referred in a most contemptible way to the … charac-\\nter of Sofya Semyonovna, that is, hinted at the character of \\nmy attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. All this you understand \\nwas with the object of dividing me from my mother and \\nsister, by insinuating that I was squandering on unwor-\\nthy objects the money which they had sent me and which \\nwas all they had. Yesterday evening, before my mother and \\nsister and in his presence, I declared that I had given the \\nmoney to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to So-\\nfya Semyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya \\nSemyonovna and had never seen her before, indeed. At the \\nsame time I added that he, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with \\nall his virtues, was not worth Sofya Semyonovna’s little fin-\\nger, though he spoke so ill of her. To his question—would I \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf649\\uf647\\nlet Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I answered \\nthat I had already done so that day. Irritated that my mother \\nand sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insin-\\nuations, he gradually began being unpardonably rude to \\nthem. A final rupture took place and he was turned out of \\nthe house. All this happened yesterday evening. Now I beg \\nyour special attention: consider: if he had now succeeded in \\nproving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he would have \\nshown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in \\nhis suspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my put-\\nting my sister on a level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in \\nattacking me, he was protecting and preserving the honour \\nof my sister, his betrothed. In fact he might even, through \\nall this, have been able to estrange me from my family, and \\nno doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say \\nnothing of revenging himself on me personally, for he has \\ngrounds for supposing that the honour and happiness of \\nSofya Semyonovna are very precious to me. That was what \\nhe was working for! That’s how I understand it. That’s the \\nwhole reason for it and there can be no other!’\\nIt was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov \\nwound up his speech which was followed very attentively, \\nthough often interrupted by exclamations from his audi-\\nence. But in spite of interruptions he spoke clearly, calmly, \\nexactly, firmly. His decisive voice, his tone of conviction \\nand his stern face made a great impression on everyone.\\n‘Yes, yes, that’s it,’ Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, ‘that \\nmust be it, for he asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna \\ncame into our room, whether you were here, whether I had \\n\\uf648\\uf649\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nseen you among Katerina Ivanovna’s guests. He called me \\naside to the window and asked me in secret. It was essential \\nfor him that you should be here! That’s it, that’s it!’\\nLuzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak.',\n",
              " 'But \\nhe was very pale. He seemed to be deliberating on some \\nmeans of escape. Perhaps he would have been glad to give \\nup everything and get away, but at the moment this was \\nscarcely possible. It would have implied admitting the truth \\nof the accusations brought against him. Moreover, the com-\\npany, which had already been excited by drink, was now too \\nmuch stirred to allow it. The commissariat clerk, though in-\\ndeed he had not grasped the whole position, was shouting \\nlouder than anyone and was making some suggestions very \\nunpleasant to Luzhin. But not all those present were drunk; \\nlodgers came in from all the rooms. The three Poles were \\ntremendously excited and were continually shouting at him: \\n‘The pan is a lajdak!’ and muttering threats in Polish. Sonia \\nhad been listening with strained attention, though she too \\nseemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as though she had \\njust returned to consciousness. She did not take her eyes off \\nRaskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him. Katerina \\nIvanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearful-\\nly exhausted. Amalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid \\nthan anyone, with her mouth wide open, unable to make \\nout what had happened. She only saw that Pyotr Petrovitch \\nhad somehow come to grief.\\nRaskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they \\ndid not let him. Everyone was crowding round Luzhin with \\nthreats and shouts of abuse. But Pyotr Petrovitch was not \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf649\\uf649\\nintimidated. Seeing that his accusation of Sonia had com-\\npletely failed, he had recourse to insolence:\\n‘Allow me, gentlemen, allow me! Don’t squeeze, let me \\npass!’ he said, making his way through the crowd. ‘And no \\nthreats, if you please! I assure you it will be useless, you will \\ngain nothing by it. On the contrary, you’ll have to answer, \\ngentlemen, for violently obstructing the course of justice. \\nThe thief has been more than unmasked, and I shall pros-\\necute. Our judges are not so blind and … not so drunk, \\nand will not believe the testimony of two notorious infi-\\ndels, agitators, and atheists, who accuse me from motives of \\npersonal revenge which they are foolish enough to admit…. \\nYes, allow me to pass!’\\n‘Don’t let me find a trace of you in my room! Kindly leave \\nat once, and everything is at an end between us! When I \\nthink of the trouble I’ve been taking, the way I’ve been ex-\\npounding … all this fortnight!’\\n‘I told you myself to-day that I was going, when you tried \\nto keep me; now I will simply add that you are a fool. I ad-\\nvise you to see a doctor for your brains and your short sight. \\nLet me pass, gentlemen!’\\nHe forced his way through. But the commissariat clerk \\nwas unwilling to let him off so easily: he picked up a glass \\nfrom the table, brandished it in the air and flung it at Pyotr \\nPetrovitch; but the glass flew straight at Amalia Ivanovna. \\nShe screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing, fell heavily un-\\nder the table. Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his room \\nand half an hour later had left the house. Sonia, timid by \\nnature, had felt before that day that she could be ill- treated \\n\\uf648\\uf649\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nmore easily than anyone, and that she could be wronged \\nwith impunity. Yet till that moment she had fancied that she \\nmight escape misfortune by care, gentleness and submis-\\nsiveness before everyone. Her disappointment was too great. \\nShe could, of course, bear with patience and almost with-\\nout murmur anything, even this. But for the first minute \\nshe felt it too bitter. In spite of her triumph and her justifi-\\ncation—when her first terror and stupefaction had passed \\nand she could understand it all clearly—the feeling of her \\nhelplessness and of the wrong done to her made her heart \\nthrob with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical \\nweeping. At last, unable to bear any more, she rushed out \\nof the room and ran home, almost immediately after Lu-\\nzhin’s departure. When amidst loud laughter the glass flew \\nat Amalia Ivanovna, it was more than the landlady could \\nendure. With a shriek she rushed like a fury at Katerina Iva-\\nnovna, considering her to blame for everything.\\n‘Out of my lodgings! At once! Quick march!’\\nAnd with these words she began snatching up every-\\nthing she could lay her hands on that belonged to Katerina \\nIvanovna, and throwing it on the floor. Katerina Ivanovna, \\npale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath, jumped up \\nfrom the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and dart-\\ned at Amalia Ivanovna. But the battle was too unequal: the \\nlandlady waved her away like a feather.',\n",
              " '‘What! As though that godless calumny was not enough—\\nthis vile creature attacks me! What! On the day of my \\nhusband’s funeral I am turned out of my lodging!

Polen-\\nka with the two little ones in her arms crouched, terrified, \\non the trunk in the corner of the room, where she waited \\ntrembling for her mother to come back.

The lodgers talked \\nincoherently, some commented to the best of their ability \\non what had happened, others quarrelled and swore at one \\nanother, while others struck up a song….\\n‘Now it’s time for me to go,’ thought Raskolnikov. ‘Well, \\nSofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!’\\nAnd he set off in the direction of Sonia’s lodgings.\\n\\uf648\\uf649\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter IV\\nR\\naskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion \\nof Sonia against Luzhin, although he had such a load \\nof horror and anguish in his own heart. But having gone \\nthrough so much in the morning, he found a sort of relief \\nin a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal \\nfeeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was agi-\\ntated too, especially at some moments, by the thought of his \\napproaching interview with Sonia: he had to tell her who \\nhad killed Lizaveta. He knew the terrible suffering it would \\nbe to him and, as it were, brushed away the thought of it. \\nSo when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovna’s, ‘Well, So-\\nfya Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!’ he was \\nstill superficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from \\nhis triumph over Luzhin. But, strange to say, by the time \\nhe reached Sonia’s lodging, he felt a sudden impotence and \\nfear. He stood still in hesitation at the door, asking himself \\nthe strange question: ‘Must he tell her who killed Lizaveta?’ \\nIt was a strange question because he felt at the very time not \\nonly that he could not help telling her, but also that he could \\nnot put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be \\nso, he only felt it, and the agonising sense of his impotence \\nbefore the inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his \\nhesitation and suffering, he quickly opened the door and \\nlooked at Sonia from the doorway. She was sitting with her \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf64a0\\nelbows on the table and her face in her hands, but seeing \\nRaskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet him as \\nthough she were expecting him.\\n‘What would have become of me but for you?’ she said \\nquickly, meeting him in the middle of the room.\\nEvidently she was in haste to say this to him. It was what \\nshe had been waiting for.\\nRaskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair \\nfrom which she had only just risen. She stood facing him, \\ntwo steps away, just as she had done the day before.\\n‘Well, Sonia?’ he said, and felt that his voice was trem-\\nbling, ‘it was all due to ‘your social position and the habits \\nassociated with it.’ Did you understand that just now?’\\nHer face showed her distress.\\n‘Only don’t talk to me as you did yesterday,’ she inter-\\nrupted him. ‘Please don’t begin it. There is misery enough \\nwithout that.’\\nShe made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like \\nthe reproach.\\n‘I was silly to come away from there. What is happening \\nthere now? I wanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking \\nthat … you would come.’\\nHe told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out \\nof their lodging and that Katerina Ivanovna had run off \\nsomewhere ‘to seek justice.’\\n‘My God!’ cried Sonia, ‘let’s go at once….’\\nAnd she snatched up her cape.\\n‘It’s everlastingly the same thing!’ said Raskolnikov, irri-\\ntably. ‘You’ve no thought except for them! Stay a little with \\n\\uf648\\uf64a1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nme.’\\n‘But … Katerina Ivanovna?’\\n‘You won’t lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, \\nshe’ll come to you herself since she has run out,’ he added \\npeevishly.',\n",
              " '‘If she doesn’t find you here, you’ll be blamed for \\nit….’\\nSonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was si-\\nlent, gazing at the floor and deliberating.\\n‘This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you,’ he be-\\ngan, not looking at Sonia, ‘but if he had wanted to, if it had \\nsuited his plans, he would have sent you to prison if it had \\nnot been for Lebeziatnikov and me. Ah?’\\n‘Yes,’ she assented in a faint voice. ‘Yes,’ she repeated, pre-\\noccupied and distressed.\\n‘But I might easily not have been there. And it was quite \\nan accident Lebeziatnikov’s turning up.’\\nSonia was silent.\\n‘And if you’d gone to prison, what then? Do you remem-\\nber what I said yesterday?’\\nAgain she did not answer. He waited.\\n‘I thought you would cry out again ‘don’t speak of it, \\nleave off.’’ Raskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one. \\n‘What, silence again?’ he asked a minute later. ‘We must \\ntalk about something, you know. It would be interesting \\nfor me to know how you would decide a certain ‘problem’ \\nas Lebeziatnikov would say.’ (He was beginning to lose the \\nthread.) ‘No, really, I am serious. Imagine, Sonia, that you \\nhad known all Luzhin’s intentions beforehand. Known, \\nthat is, for a fact, that they would be the ruin of Katerina \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf64a\\uf645\\nIvanovna and the children and yourself thrown in—since \\nyou don’t count yourself for anything—Polenka too … for \\nshe’ll go the same way. Well, if suddenly it all depended on \\nyour decision whether he or they should go on living, that \\nis whether Luzhin should go on living and doing wicked \\nthings, or Katerina Ivanovna should die? How would you \\ndecide which of them was to die? I ask you?’\\nSonia looked uneasily at him. There was something pecu-\\nliar in this hesitating question, which seemed approaching \\nsomething in a roundabout way.\\n‘I felt that you were going to ask some question like that,’ \\nshe said, looking inquisitively at him.\\n‘I dare say you did. But how is it to be answered?’\\n‘Why do you ask about what could not happen?’ said So-\\nnia reluctantly.\\n‘Then it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and do-\\ning wicked things? You haven’t dared to decide even that!’\\n‘But I can’t know the Divine Providence…. And why do \\nyou ask what can’t be answered? What’s the use of such fool-\\nish questions? How could it happen that it should depend \\non my decision—who has made me a judge to decide who is \\nto live and who is not to live?’\\n‘Oh, if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it, there \\nis no doing anything,’ Raskolnikov grumbled morosely.\\n‘You’d better say straight out what you want!’ Sonia cried \\nin distress. ‘You are leading up to something again…. Can \\nyou have come simply to torture me?’\\nShe could not control herself and began crying bitterly. \\nHe looked at her in gloomy misery. Five minutes passed.\\n\\uf648\\uf64a\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘Of course you’re right, Sonia,’ he said softly at last. He \\nwas suddenly changed. His tone of assumed arrogance and \\nhelpless defiance was gone. Even his voice was sudden-\\nly weak. ‘I told you yesterday that I was not coming to ask \\nforgiveness and almost the first thing I’ve said is to ask for-\\ngiveness…. I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my \\nown sake. I was asking forgiveness, Sonia….',\n",

He bowed his head and hid his \\nface in his hands.\\nAnd suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of \\nbitter hatred for Sonia passed through his heart. As it were \\nwondering and frightened of this sensation, he raised his \\nhead and looked intently at her; but he met her uneasy and \\npainfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was love in them; \\nhis hatred vanished like a phantom. It was not the real feel-\\ning; he had taken the one feeling for the other. It only meant \\nthat that minute had come.\\nHe hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head. \\nSuddenly he turned pale, got up from his chair, looked at \\nSonia, and without uttering a word sat down mechanically \\non her bed.\\nHis sensations that moment were terribly like the mo-\\nment when he had stood over the old woman with the axe in \\nhis hand and felt that ‘he must not lose another minute.’\\n‘What’s the matter?’ asked Sonia, dreadfully frightened.\\nHe could not utter a word. This was not at all, not at all \\nthe way he had intended to ‘tell’ and he did not understand \\nwhat was happening to him now. She went up to him, softly, \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf64a\\uf647\\nsat down on the bed beside him and waited, not taking her \\neyes off him. Her heart throbbed and sank. It was unendur-\\nable; he turned his deadly pale face to her. His lips worked, \\nhelplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror \\npassed through Sonia’s heart.\\n‘What’s the matter?’ she repeated, drawing a little away \\nfrom him.\\n‘Nothing, Sonia, don’t be frightened…. It’s nonsense. \\nIt really is nonsense, if you think of it,’ he muttered, like \\na man in delirium. ‘Why have I come to torture you?’ he \\nadded suddenly, looking at her. ‘Why, really? I keep asking \\nmyself that question, Sonia….’\\nHe had perhaps been asking himself that question \\na quarter of an hour before, but now he spoke helplessly, \\nhardly knowing what he said and feeling a continual tremor \\nall over.\\n‘Oh, how you are suffering!’ she muttered in distress, \\nlooking intently at him.\\n‘It’s all nonsense…. Listen, Sonia.’ He suddenly smiled, a \\npale helpless smile for two seconds. ‘You remember what I \\nmeant to tell you yesterday?’\\nSonia waited uneasily.\\n‘I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye \\nfor ever, but that if I came to-day I would tell you who … \\nwho killed Lizaveta.’\\nShe began trembling all over.\\n‘Well, here I’ve come to tell you.’\\n‘Then you really meant it yesterday?’ she whispered with \\ndifficulty. ‘How do you know?’ she asked quickly, as though \\n\\uf648\\uf64a\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nsuddenly regaining her reason.\\nSonia’s face grew paler and paler, and she breathed pain-\\nfully.\\n‘I know.’\\nShe paused a minute.\\n‘Have they found him?’ she asked timidly.\\n‘No.',\n",
              " '’\\n‘Then how do you know about it?’ she asked again, hardly \\naudibly and again after a minute’s pause.\\nHe turned to her and looked very intently at her.\\n‘Guess,’ he said, with the same distorted helpless smile.\\nA shudder passed over her.\\n‘But you … why do you frighten me like this?’ she said, \\nsmiling like a child.\\n‘I must be a great friend of his … since I know,’ Raskol-\\nnikov went on, still gazing into her face, as though he could \\nnot turn his eyes away. ‘He … did not mean to kill that Liza-\\nveta … he … killed her accidentally…. He meant to kill the \\nold woman when she was alone and he went there … and \\nthen Lizaveta came in … he killed her too.’\\nAnother awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one \\nanother.\\n‘You can’t guess, then?’ he asked suddenly, feeling as \\nthough he were flinging himself down from a steeple.\\n‘N-no …’ whispered Sonia.\\n‘Take a good look.’\\nAs soon as he had said this again, the same familiar \\nsensation froze his heart. He looked at her and all at once \\nseemed to see in her face the face of Lizaveta. He remem-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf64a\\uf649\\nbered clearly the expression in Lizaveta’s face, when he \\napproached her with the axe and she stepped back to the \\nwall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, \\nlooking as little children do when they begin to be fright-\\nened of something, looking intently and uneasily at what \\nfrightens them, shrinking back and holding out their little \\nhands on the point of crying. Almost the same thing hap-\\npened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the \\nsame terror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly \\nputting out her left hand, pressed her fingers faintly against \\nhis breast and slowly began to get up from the bed, mov-\\ning further from him and keeping her eyes fixed even more \\nimmovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fear \\nshowed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her \\nand almost with the same childish smile.\\n‘Have you guessed?’ he whispered at last.\\n‘Good God!’ broke in an awful wail from her bosom.\\nShe sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pil-\\nlows, but a moment later she got up, moved quickly to him, \\nseized both his hands and, gripping them tight in her thin \\nfingers, began looking into his face again with the same in-\\ntent stare. In this last desperate look she tried to look into \\nhim and catch some last hope. But there was no hope; there \\nwas no doubt remaining; it was all true! Later on, indeed, \\nwhen she recalled that moment, she thought it strange and \\nwondered why she had seen at once that there was no doubt. \\nShe could not have said, for instance, that she had foreseen \\nsomething of the sort—and yet now, as soon as he told her, \\nshe suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen this very \\n\\uf648\\uf64a\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthing.\\n‘Stop, Sonia, enough! don’t torture me,’ he begged her \\nmiserably.\\nIt was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of tell-\\ning her, but this is how it happened.\\nShe jumped up, seeming not to know what she was do-\\ning, and, wringing her hands, walked into the middle of the \\nroom; but quickly went back and sat down again beside him, \\nher shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden she start-\\ned as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on \\nher knees before him, she did not know why.\\n‘What have you done—what have you done to yourself?’ \\nshe said in despair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on \\nhis neck, threw her arms round him, and held him tightly.\\nRaskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mourn-\\nful smile.\\n‘You are a strange girl, Sonia—you kiss me and hug me \\nwhen I tell you about that…. You don’t think what you are \\ndoing.’\\n‘There is no one—no one in the whole world now so un-\\nhappy as you!’ she cried in a frenzy, not hearing what he \\nsaid, and she suddenly broke into violent hysterical weep-\\ning.\\nA feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and \\nsoftened it at once. He did not struggle against it. Two tears \\nstarted into his eyes and hung on his eyelashes.',\n",
              " '‘Then you won’t leave me, Sonia?’ he said, looking at her \\nalmost with hope.\\n‘No, no, never, nowhere!’ cried Sonia. ‘I will follow you, I \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf64a\\uf64b\\nwill follow you everywhere. Oh, my God! Oh, how misera-\\nble I am! … Why, why didn’t I know you before! Why didn’t \\nyou come before? Oh, dear!’\\n‘Here I have come.’\\n‘Yes, now! What’s to be done now? … Together, together!’ \\nshe repeated as it were unconsciously, and she hugged him \\nagain. ‘I’ll follow you to Siberia!’\\nHe recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty \\nsmile came to his lips.\\n‘Perhaps I don’t want to go to Siberia yet, Sonia,’ he said.\\nSonia looked at him quickly.\\nAgain after her first passionate, agonising sympathy \\nfor the unhappy man the terrible idea of the murder over-\\nwhelmed her. In his changed tone she seemed to hear the \\nmurderer speaking. She looked at him bewildered. She \\nknew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. \\nNow all these questions rushed at once into her mind. And \\nagain she could not believe it: ‘He, he is a murderer! Could \\nit be true?’\\n‘What’s the meaning of it? Where am I?’ she said in com-\\nplete bewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself. \\n‘How could you, you, a man like you…. How could you \\nbring yourself to it? … What does it mean?’\\n‘Oh, well—to plunder. Leave off, Sonia,’ he answered \\nwearily, almost with vexation.\\nSonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she \\ncried:\\n‘You were hungry! It was … to help your mother? Yes?’\\n‘No, Sonia, no,’ he muttered, turning away and hanging \\n\\uf648\\uf64a\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nhis head. ‘I was not so hungry…. I certainly did want to help \\nmy mother, but … that’s not the real thing either…. Don’t \\ntorture me, Sonia.’\\nSonia clasped her hands.\\n‘Could it, could it all be true? Good God, what a truth! \\nWho could believe it? And how could you give away your \\nlast farthing and yet rob and murder! Ah,’ she cried sud-\\ndenly, ‘that money you gave Katerina Ivanovna … that \\nmoney…. Can that money …’\\n‘No, Sonia,’ he broke in hurriedly, ‘that money was not \\nit. Don’t worry yourself! That money my mother sent me \\nand it came when I was ill, the day I gave it to you…. Ra-\\nzumihin saw it … he received it for me…. That money was \\nmine—my own.’\\nSonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her ut-\\nmost to comprehend.\\n‘And that money…. I don’t even know really whether \\nthere was any money,’ he added softly, as though reflect-\\ning. ‘I took a purse off her neck, made of chamois leather … \\na purse stuffed full of something … but I didn’t look in it; I \\nsuppose I hadn’t time…. And the things—chains and trin-\\nkets—I buried under a stone with the purse next morning \\nin a yard off the V—— Prospect. They are all there now…. .’\\nSonia strained every nerve to listen.\\n‘Then why … why, you said you did it to rob, but you took \\nnothing?’ she asked quickly, catching at a straw.\\n‘I don’t know…. I haven’t yet decided whether to take that \\nmoney or not,’ he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake \\nup with a start, he gave a brief ironical smile. ‘Ach, what silly \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf64b0\\nstuff I am talking, eh?’\\nThe thought flashed through Sonia’s mind, wasn’t he \\nmad? But she dismissed it at once.',\n",
              " '‘No, it was something \\nelse.’ She could make nothing of it, nothing.\\n‘Do you know, Sonia,’ he said suddenly with conviction, \\n‘let me tell you: if I’d simply killed because I was hungry,’ \\nlaying stress on every word and looking enigmatically but \\nsincerely at her, ‘I should be happy now. You must believe \\nthat! What would it matter to you,’ he cried a moment later \\nwith a sort of despair, ‘what would it matter to you if I were \\nto confess that I did wrong? What do you gain by such a stu-\\npid triumph over me? Ah, Sonia, was it for that I’ve come to \\nyou to-day?’\\nAgain Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.\\n‘I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all \\nI have left.’\\n‘Go where?’ asked Sonia timidly.\\n‘Not to steal and not to murder, don’t be anxious,’ he \\nsmiled bitterly. ‘We are so different…. And you know, So-\\nnia, it’s only now, only this moment that I understand where \\nI asked you to go with me yesterday! Yesterday when I said \\nit I did not know where. I asked you for one thing, I came \\nto you for one thing—not to leave me. You won’t leave me, \\nSonia?’\\nShe squeezed his hand.\\n‘And why, why did I tell her? Why did I let her know?’ \\nhe cried a minute later in despair, looking with infinite \\nanguish at her. ‘Here you expect an explanation from me, \\nSonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see that. But what \\n\\uf648\\uf64b1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ncan I tell you? You won’t understand and will only suffer \\nmisery … on my account! Well, you are crying and embrac-\\ning me again. Why do you do it? Because I couldn’t bear my \\nburden and have come to throw it on another: you suffer \\ntoo, and I shall feel better! And can you love such a mean \\nwretch?’\\n‘But aren’t you suffering, too?’ cried Sonia.\\nAgain a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, \\nand again for an instant softened it.\\n‘Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may ex-\\nplain a great deal. I have come because I am bad. There are \\nmen who wouldn’t have come. But I am a coward and … \\na mean wretch. But … never mind! That’s not the point. I \\nmust speak now, but I don’t know how to begin.’\\nHe paused and sank into thought.\\n‘Ach, we are so different,’ he cried again, ‘we are not alike. \\nAnd why, why did I come? I shall never forgive myself that.’\\n‘No, no, it was a good thing you came,’ cried Sonia. ‘It’s \\nbetter I should know, far better!’\\nHe looked at her with anguish.\\n‘What if it were really that?’ he said, as though reaching \\na conclusion. ‘Yes, that’s what it was! I wanted to become \\na Napoleon, that is why I killed her…. Do you understand \\nnow?’\\n‘N-no,’ Sonia whispered naïvely and timidly. ‘Only speak, \\nspeak, I shall understand, I shall understand in myself!’ she \\nkept begging him.\\n‘You’ll understand? Very well, we shall see!’ He paused \\nand was for some time lost in meditation.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf648\\uf64b\\uf645\\n‘It was like this: I asked myself one day this question—\\nwhat if Napoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my \\nplace, and if he had not had Toulon nor Egypt nor the pas-\\nsage of Mont Blanc to begin his career with, but instead of \\nall those picturesque and monumental things, there had \\nsimply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who \\nhad to be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for \\nhis career, you understand). Well, would he have brought \\nhimself to that if there had been no other means? Wouldn’t \\nhe have felt a pang at its being so far from monumental and \\n… and sinful, too? Well, I must tell you that I worried myself \\nfearfully over that ‘question’ so that I was awfully ashamed \\nwhen I guessed at last (all of a sudden, somehow) that it \\nwould not have given him the least pang, that it would not \\neven have struck him that it was not monumental … that he \\nwould not have seen that there was anything in it to pause \\nover, and that, if he had had no other way, he would have \\nstrangled her in a minute without thinking about it! Well, I \\ntoo … left off thinking about it … murdered her, following \\nhis example. And that’s exactly how it was! Do you think it \\nfunny? Yes, Sonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps \\nthat’s just how it was.’\\nSonia did not think it at all funny.\\n‘You had better tell me straight out … without examples,’ \\nshe begged, still more timidly and scarcely audibly.\\nHe turned to her, looked sadly at her and took her \\nhands.',\n",

Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress with \\nthe green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hid-\\neous way on one side, was really frantic. She was exhausted \\nand breathless. Her wasted consumptive face looked more \\nsuffering than ever, and indeed out of doors in the sunshine \\na consumptive always looks worse than at home. But her ex-\\ncitement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew \\nmore intense. She rushed at the children, shouted at them, \\ncoaxed them, told them before the crowd how to dance and \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64900\\nwhat to sing, began explaining to them why it was neces-\\nsary, and driven to desperation by their not understanding, \\nbeat them…. Then she would make a rush at the crowd; if \\nshe noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, \\nshe immediately appealed to him to see what these children \\n‘from a genteel, one may say aristocratic, house’ had been \\nbrought to. If she heard laughter or jeering in the crowd, \\nshe would rush at once at the scoffers and begin squabbling \\nwith them.

What business is it of yours?’\\n‘You have to get a licence for an organ, and you haven’t \\ngot one, and in that way you collect a crowd. Where do you \\nlodge?’\\n‘What, a license?’ wailed Katerina Ivanovna. ‘I buried my \\nhusband to-day. What need of a license?’\\n‘Calm yourself, madam, calm yourself,’ began the official. \\n‘Come along; I will escort you…. This is no place for you in \\nthe crowd. You are ill.’\\n‘Honoured sir, honoured sir, you don’t know,’ screamed \\nKaterina Ivanovna. ‘We are going to the Nevsky…. Sonia, \\nSonia! Where is she? She is crying too! What’s the matter \\nwith you all? Kolya, Lida, where are you going?’ she cried \\nsuddenly in alarm. ‘Oh, silly children! Kolya, Lida, where \\nare they off to? …’\\nKolya and Lida, scared out of their wits by the crowd, \\nand their mother’s mad pranks, suddenly seized each oth-\\ner by the hand, and ran off at the sight of the policeman \\nwho wanted to take them away somewhere. Weeping and \\nwailing, poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them. She was \\na piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she ran, weeping and \\npanting for breath.',\n",

Pass on!’ he said to the crowd that pressed for-\\nward.\\n‘She’s dying,’ someone shouted.\\n‘She’s gone out of her mind,’ said another.\\n‘Lord have mercy upon us,’ said a woman, crossing her-\\nself. ‘Have they caught the little girl and the boy? They’re \\nbeing brought back, the elder one’s got them…. Ah, the \\nnaughty imps!’\\nWhen they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they \\nsaw that she had not cut herself against a stone, as Sonia \\nthought, but that the blood that stained the pavement red \\nwas from her chest.\\n‘I’ve seen that before,’ muttered the official to Raskol-\\nnikov and Lebeziatnikov; ‘that’s consumption; the blood \\nflows and chokes the patient. I saw the same thing with a \\nrelative of my own not long ago … nearly a pint of blood, all \\nin a minute…. What’s to be done though? She is dying.’\\n‘This way, this way, to my room!’ Sonia implored. ‘I live \\nhere! … See, that house, the second from here….

Oh, dear!’\\n\\uf6490\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nThanks to the official’s efforts, this plan was adopted, the \\npoliceman even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She \\nwas carried to Sonia’s room, almost unconscious, and laid \\non the bed. The blood was still flowing, but she seemed to \\nbe coming to herself. Raskolnikov, Lebeziatnikov, and the \\nofficial accompanied Sonia into the room and were followed \\nby the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which fol-\\nlowed to the very door. Polenka came in holding Kolya and \\nLida, who were trembling and weeping. Several persons \\ncame in too from the Kapernaumovs’ room; the landlord, \\na lame one-eyed man of strange appearance with whis-\\nkers and hair that stood up like a brush, his wife, a woman \\nwith an everlastingly scared expression, and several open-\\nmouthed children with wonder-struck faces. Among these, \\nSvidrigaïlov suddenly made his appearance. Raskolnikov \\nlooked at him with surprise, not understanding where he \\nhad come from and not having noticed him in the crowd. \\nA doctor and priest wore spoken of. The official whispered \\nto Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now for the \\ndoctor, but he ordered him to be sent for. Kapernaumov ran \\nhimself.\\nMeanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath. \\nThe bleeding ceased for a time. She looked with sick but \\nintent and penetrating eyes at Sonia, who stood pale and \\ntrembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with a handker-\\nchief. At last she asked to be raised. They sat her up on the \\nbed, supporting her on both sides.\\n‘Where are the children?’ she said in a faint voice. ‘You’ve \\nbrought them, Polenka? Oh the sillies! Why did you run \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6490\\uf64b\\naway…. Och!’\\nOnce more her parched lips were covered with blood. \\nShe moved her eyes, looking about her.\\n‘So that’s how you live, Sonia! Never once have I been in \\nyour room.',\n",
              " '’\\nShe looked at her with a face of suffering.\\n‘We have been your ruin, Sonia. Polenka, Lida, Kolya, \\ncome here! Well, here they are, Sonia, take them all! I hand \\nthem over to you, I’ve had enough! The ball is over.’ (Cough!) \\n‘Lay me down, let me die in peace.’\\nThey laid her back on the pillow.\\n‘What, the priest? I don’t want him. You haven’t got a \\nrouble to spare. I have no sins. God must forgive me with-\\nout that. He knows how I have suffered…. And if He won’t \\nforgive me, I don’t care!’\\nShe sank more and more into uneasy delirium. At times \\nshe shuddered, turned her eyes from side to side, recog-\\nnised everyone for a minute, but at once sank into delirium \\nagain. Her breathing was hoarse and difficult, there was a \\nsort of rattle in her throat.\\n‘I said to him, your excellency,’ she ejaculated, gasping \\nafter each word. ‘That Amalia Ludwigovna, ah! Lida, Kolya, \\nhands on your hips, make haste! Glissez, glissez! pas de \\nbasque! Tap with your heels, be a graceful child!\\n‘Du hast Diamanten und Perlen\\n‘What next?

It’s over! Farewell, poor thing! I am done for! I \\nam broken!’ she cried with vindictive despair, and her head \\nfell heavily back on the pillow.\\nShe sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did \\nnot last long.

Polenka threw herself at her moth-\\ner’s feet, kissing them and weeping violently. Though Kolya \\nand Lida did not understand what had happened, they had \\na feeling that it was something terrible; they put their hands \\non each other’s little shoulders, stared straight at one an-\\nother and both at once opened their mouths and began \\nscreaming. They were both still in their fancy dress; one in \\na turban, the other in the cap with the ostrich feather.\\nAnd how did ‘the certificate of merit’ come to be on the \\nbed beside Katerina Ivanovna?

              " 'You know it’s a question of money and, as I told you, \\nI have plenty to spare.

Won’t you admit that it’s \\nsimply done from humanity? She wasn’t ‘a louse,’ you know’ \\n(he pointed to the corner where the dead woman lay), ‘was \\nshe, like some old pawnbroker woman? Come, you’ll agree, \\nis Luzhin to go on living, and doing wicked things or is \\nshe to die? And if I didn’t help them, Polenka would go the \\nsame way.’\\nHe said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness, \\nkeeping his eyes fixed on Raskolnikov, who turned white \\nand cold, hearing his own phrases, spoken to Sonia. He \\nquickly stepped back and looked wildly at Svidrigaïlov.\\n‘How do you know?’ he whispered, hardly able to \\nbreathe.\\n‘Why, I lodge here at Madame Resslich’s, the other side \\nof the wall. Here is Kapernaumov, and there lives Madame \\nResslich, an old and devoted friend of mine.

I told you we should \\nbecome friends, I foretold it. Well, here we have. And you \\nwill see what an accommodating person I am. You’ll see \\nthat you can get on with me!’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6491\\uf645\\nPart VI\\n\\uf6491\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter I\\nA \\nstrange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though \\na fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary \\nsolitude from which there was no escape. Recalling that pe-\\nriod long after, he believed that his mind had been clouded \\nat times, and that it had continued so, with intervals, till \\nthe final catastrophe. He was convinced that he had been \\nmistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to \\nthe date of certain events. Anyway, when he tried later on to \\npiece his recollections together, he learnt a great deal about \\nhimself from what other people told him. He had mixed up \\nincidents and had explained events as due to circumstanc-\\nes which existed only in his imagination. At times he was \\na prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting some-\\ntimes to panic. But he remembered, too, moments, hours, \\nperhaps whole days, of complete apathy, which came upon \\nhim as a reaction from his previous terror and might be \\ncompared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes seen \\nin the dying. He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to \\nescape from a full and clear understanding of his position. \\nCertain essential facts which required immediate consider-\\nation were particularly irksome to him. How glad he would \\nhave been to be free from some cares, the neglect of which \\nwould have threatened him with complete, inevitable ruin.\\nHe was particularly worried about Svidrigaïlov, he might \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6491\\uf647\\nbe said to be permanently thinking of Svidrigaïlov. From \\nthe time of Svidrigaïlov’s too menacing and unmistakable \\nwords in Sonia’s room at the moment of Katerina Ivanov-\\nna’s death, the normal working of his mind seemed to break \\ndown. But although this new fact caused him extreme un-\\neasiness, Raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation \\nof it. At times, finding himself in a solitary and remote part \\nof the town, in some wretched eating-house, sitting alone \\nlost in thought, hardly knowing how he had come there, he \\nsuddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov. He recognised suddenly, \\nclearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an \\nunderstanding with that man and to make what terms he \\ncould. Walking outside the city gates one day, he positive-\\nly fancied that they had fixed a meeting there, that he was \\nwaiting for Svidrigaïlov. Another time he woke up before \\ndaybreak lying on the ground under some bushes and could \\nnot at first understand how he had come there.\\nBut during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanov-\\nna’s death, he had two or three times met Svidrigaïlov at \\nSonia’s lodging, where he had gone aimlessly for a moment. \\nThey exchanged a few words and made no reference to the \\nvital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not to speak \\nof it for a time.\\nKaterina Ivanovna’s body was still lying in the coffin, \\nSvidrigaïlov was busy making arrangements for the funeral.',\n",
              " 'Sonia too was very busy. At their last meeting Svidrigaïlov \\ninformed Raskolnikov that he had made an arrangement, \\nand a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna’s chil-\\ndren; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded \\n\\uf6491\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nin getting hold of certain personages by whose help the \\nthree orphans could be at once placed in very suitable insti-\\ntutions; that the money he had settled on them had been of \\ngreat assistance, as it is much easier to place orphans with \\nsome property than destitute ones. He said something too \\nabout Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two \\nto see Raskolnikov, mentioning that ‘he would like to con-\\nsult with him, that there were things they must talk over….’\\nThis conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. \\nSvidrigaïlov looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, \\nafter a brief pause, dropping his voice, asked: ‘But how is \\nit, Rodion Romanovitch; you don’t seem yourself? You look \\nand you listen, but you don’t seem to understand. Cheer up! \\nWe’ll talk things over; I am only sorry, I’ve so much to do \\nof my own business and other people’s. Ah, Rodion Roma-\\nnovitch,’ he added suddenly, ‘what all men need is fresh air, \\nfresh air … more than anything!’\\nHe moved to one side to make way for the priest and \\nserver, who were coming up the stairs. They had come for \\nthe requiem service. By Svidrigaïlov’s orders it was sung \\ntwice a day punctually. Svidrigaïlov went his way. Raskol-\\nnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed the priest \\ninto Sonia’s room. He stood at the door. They began quietly, \\nslowly and mournfully singing the service. From his child-\\nhood the thought of death and the presence of death had \\nsomething oppressive and mysteriously awful; and it was \\nlong since he had heard the requiem service. And there was \\nsomething else here as well, too awful and disturbing. He \\nlooked at the children: they were all kneeling by the cof-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6491\\uf649\\nfin; Polenka was weeping. Behind them Sonia prayed, softly \\nand, as it were, timidly weeping.\\n‘These last two days she hasn’t said a word to me, she \\nhasn’t glanced at me,’ Raskolnikov thought suddenly. The \\nsunlight was bright in the room; the incense rose in clouds; \\nthe priest read, ‘Give rest, oh Lord….’ Raskolnikov stayed \\nall through the service. As he blessed them and took his \\nleave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service, \\nRaskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and \\nlet her head sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly ges-\\nture bewildered Raskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that \\nthere was no trace of repugnance, no trace of disgust, no \\ntremor in her hand. It was the furthest limit of self-abnega-\\ntion, at least so he interpreted it.\\nSonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and \\nwent out. He felt very miserable. If it had been possible to \\nescape to some solitude, he would have thought himself \\nlucky, even if he had to spend his whole life there. But al-\\nthough he had almost always been by himself of late, he \\nhad never been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out \\nof the town on to the high road, once he had even reached \\na little wood, but the lonelier the place was, the more he \\nseemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near him. It did \\nnot frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he made \\nhaste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to \\nenter restaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thorough-\\nfares. There he felt easier and even more solitary. One day \\nat dusk he sat for an hour listening to songs in a tavern and \\nhe remembered that he positively enjoyed it. But at last he \\n\\uf6491\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nhad suddenly felt the same uneasiness again, as though his \\nconscience smote him. ‘Here I sit listening to singing, is that \\nwhat I ought to be doing?’ he thought. Yet he felt at once \\nthat that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was \\nsomething requiring immediate decision, but it was some-\\nthing he could not clearly understand or put into words.',\n",
              " 'It \\nwas a hopeless tangle. ‘No, better the struggle again! Better \\nPorfiry again … or Svidrigaïlov…. Better some challenge \\nagain … some attack. Yes, yes!’ he thought. He went out of \\nthe tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of \\nDounia and his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a \\npanic. That night he woke up before morning among some \\nbushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling all over with fever; \\nhe walked home, and it was early morning when he arrived. \\nAfter some hours’ sleep the fever left him, but he woke up \\nlate, two o’clock in the afternoon.\\nHe remembered that Katerina Ivanovna’s funeral had \\nbeen fixed for that day, and was glad that he was not pres-\\nent at it. Nastasya brought him some food; he ate and drank \\nwith appetite, almost with greediness. His head was fresh-\\ner and he was calmer than he had been for the last three \\ndays. He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks \\nof panic.\\nThe door opened and Razumihin came in.\\n‘Ah, he’s eating, then he’s not ill,’ said Razumihin. He took \\na chair and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.\\nHe was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He \\nspoke with evident annoyance, but without hurry or rais-\\ning his voice. He looked as though he had some special fixed \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf6491\\uf64b\\ndetermination.\\n‘Listen,’ he began resolutely. ‘As far as I am concerned, \\nyou may all go to hell, but from what I see, it’s clear to me \\nthat I can’t make head or tail of it; please don’t think I’ve \\ncome to ask you questions. I don’t want to know, hang it! If \\nyou begin telling me your secrets, I dare say I shouldn’t stay \\nto listen, I should go away cursing. I have only come to find \\nout once for all whether it’s a fact that you are mad? There \\nis a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. \\nI admit I’ve been disposed to that opinion myself, judging \\nfrom your stupid, repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, \\nand from your recent behavior to your mother and sister. \\nOnly a monster or a madman could treat them as you have; \\nso you must be mad.’\\n‘When did you see them last?’\\n‘Just now. Haven’t you seen them since then? What have \\nyou been doing with yourself? Tell me, please. I’ve been to \\nyou three times already. Your mother has been seriously ill \\nsince yesterday. She had made up her mind to come to you; \\nAvdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her; she wouldn’t hear \\na word. ‘If he is ill, if his mind is giving way, who can look af-\\nter him like his mother?’ she said. We all came here together, \\nwe couldn’t let her come alone all the way. We kept begging \\nher to be calm. We came in, you weren’t here; she sat down, \\nand stayed ten minutes, while we stood waiting in silence. \\nShe got up and said: ‘If he’s gone out, that is, if he is well, and \\nhas forgotten his mother, it’s humiliating and unseemly for \\nhis mother to stand at his door begging for kindness.’ She \\nreturned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever. ‘I \\n\\uf6491\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nsee,’ she said, ‘that he has time for his girl. ‘ She means by \\nyour girl Sofya Semyonovna, your betrothed or your mis-\\ntress, I don’t know. I went at once to Sofya Semyonovna’s, \\nfor I wanted to know what was going on. I looked round, I \\nsaw the coffin, the children crying, and Sofya Semyonovna \\ntrying them on mourning dresses.',\n",
              " 'No sign of you. I apol-\\nogised, came away, and reported to Avdotya Romanovna. \\nSo that’s all nonsense and you haven’t got a girl; the most \\nlikely thing is that you are mad. But here you sit, guzzling \\nboiled beef as though you’d not had a bite for three days. \\nThough as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but though you \\nhave not said a word to me yet … you are not mad! That I’d \\nswear! Above all, you are not mad! So you may go to hell, all \\nof you, for there’s some mystery, some secret about it, and \\nI don’t intend to worry my brains over your secrets. So I’ve \\nsimply come to swear at you,’ he finished, getting up, ‘to re-\\nlieve my mind. And I know what to do now.’\\n‘What do you mean to do now?’\\n‘What business is it of yours what I mean to do?’\\n‘You are going in for a drinking bout.’\\n‘How … how did you know?’\\n‘Why, it’s pretty plain.’\\nRazumihin paused for a minute.\\n‘You always have been a very rational person and you’ve \\nnever been mad, never,’ he observed suddenly with warmth. \\n‘You’re right: I shall drink.

I didn’t tell her you love her, because she knows that \\nherself.’\\n‘She knows that herself?’\\n‘Well, it’s pretty plain. Wherever I might go, whatever \\nhappened to me, you would remain to look after them. I, \\nso to speak, give them into your keeping, Razumihin. I say \\nthis because I know quite well how you love her, and am \\nconvinced of the purity of your heart. I know that she too \\nmay love you and perhaps does love you already. Now de-\\ncide for yourself, as you know best, whether you need go in \\nfor a drinking bout or not.’\\n‘Rodya! You see … well…. Ach, damn it! But where do \\nyou mean to go? Of course, if it’s all a secret, never mind…. \\nBut I … I shall find out the secret … and I am sure that it \\nmust be some ridiculous nonsense and that you’ve made it \\nall up. Anyway you are a capital fellow, a capital fellow! …’\\n‘That was just what I wanted to add, only you interrupted, \\nthat that was a very good decision of yours not to find out \\nthese secrets. Leave it to time, don’t worry about it. You’ll \\n\\uf649\\uf6451\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nknow it all in time when it must be.

And … and Dounia knows,’ he thought suddenly.\\n‘So Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you,’ he said, \\nweighing each syllable, ‘and you’re going to see a man who \\nsays we need more air, and so of course that letter … that \\ntoo must have something to do with it,’ he concluded to \\nhimself.',\n",
              " '‘What letter?’\\n‘She got a letter to-day. It upset her very much—very \\nmuch indeed. Too much so. I began speaking of you, she \\nbegged me not to. Then … then she said that perhaps we \\nshould very soon have to part … then she began warmly \\nthanking me for something; then she went to her room and \\nlocked herself in.’\\n‘She got a letter?’ Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully.\\n‘Yes, and you didn’t know? hm …’\\nThey were both silent.\\n‘Good-bye, Rodion. There was a time, brother, when I…. \\nNever mind, good-bye. You see, there was a time…. Well, \\ngood-bye! I must be off too. I am not going to drink. There’s \\nno need now…. That’s all stuff!’\\nHe hurried out; but when he had almost closed the door \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf645\\uf645\\nbehind him, he suddenly opened it again, and said, look-\\ning away:\\n‘Oh, by the way, do you remember that murder, you know \\nPorfiry’s, that old woman? Do you know the murderer has \\nbeen found, he has confessed and given the proofs. It’s one \\nof those very workmen, the painter, only fancy! Do you re-\\nmember I defended them here?

Well, he’s simply a genius \\nof hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspi-\\ncions of the lawyers—so there’s nothing much to wonder \\nat, I suppose! Of course people like that are always possible. \\nAnd the fact that he couldn’t keep up the character, but con-\\nfessed, makes him easier to believe in. But what a fool I was! \\nI was frantic on their side!’\\n‘Tell me, please, from whom did you hear that, and why \\ndoes it interest you so?’ Raskolnikov asked with unmistak-\\nable agitation.\\n‘What next? You ask me why it interests me! … Well, I \\nheard it from Porfiry, among others … It was from him I \\nheard almost all about it.’\\n‘From Porfiry?’\\n‘From Porfiry.’\\n‘What … what did he say?’ Raskolnikov asked in dismay.\\n‘He gave me a capital explanation of it.

And I was almost think-\\ning … Good heavens, what I thought! Yes, I took leave of my \\nsenses and I wronged him! It was his doing, under the lamp \\nin the corridor that day. Pfoo!

              " 'As soon as Razumihin went out, Raskolnikov got up, \\nturned to the window, walked into one corner and then into \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf645\\uf647\\nanother, as though forgetting the smallness of his room, and \\nsat down again on the sofa. He felt, so to speak, renewed; \\nagain the struggle, so a means of escape had come.\\n‘Yes, a means of escape had come! It had been too sti-\\nfling, too cramping, the burden had been too agonising. A \\nlethargy had come upon him at times. From the moment of \\nthe scene with Nikolay at Porfiry’s he had been suffocating, \\npenned in without hope of escape. After Nikolay’s confes-\\nsion, on that very day had come the scene with Sonia; his \\nbehaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike any-\\nthing he could have imagined beforehand; he had grown \\nfeebler, instantly and fundamentally! And he had agreed at \\nthe time with Sonia, he had agreed in his heart he could not \\ngo on living alone with such a thing on his mind!\\n‘And Svidrigaïlov was a riddle … He worried him, that \\nwas true, but somehow not on the same point. He might \\nstill have a struggle to come with Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov, \\ntoo, might be a means of escape; but Porfiry was a different \\nmatter.\\n‘And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin, \\nhad explained it psychologically. He had begun bringing in \\nhis damned psychology again! Porfiry? But to think that \\nPorfiry should for one moment believe that Nikolay was \\nguilty, after what had passed between them before Nikolay’s \\nappearance, after that tête-à-tête interview, which could \\nhave only one explanation? (During those days Raskolnikov \\nhad often recalled passages in that scene with Porfiry; he \\ncould not bear to let his mind rest on it.) Such words, such \\ngestures had passed between them, they had exchanged \\n\\uf649\\uf645\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nsuch glances, things had been said in such a tone and had \\nreached such a pass, that Nikolay, whom Porfiry had seen \\nthrough at the first word, at the first gesture, could not have \\nshaken his conviction.\\n‘And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect! \\nThe scene in the corridor under the lamp had produced its \\neffect then. He had rushed to Porfiry…. But what had in-\\nduced the latter to receive him like that? What had been \\nhis object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay? He must \\nhave some plan; there was some design, but what was it? It \\nwas true that a long time had passed since that morning—\\ntoo long a time—and no sight nor sound of Porfiry. Well, \\nthat was a bad sign….’\\nRaskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room, still \\npondering. It was the first time for a long while that he had \\nfelt clear in his mind, at least. ‘I must settle Svidrigaïlov,’ he \\nthought, ‘and as soon as possible; he, too, seems to be wait-\\ning for me to come to him of my own accord.’ And at that \\nmoment there was such a rush of hate in his weary heart \\nthat he might have killed either of those two—Porfiry or \\nSvidrigaïlov. At least he felt that he would be capable of do-\\ning it later, if not now.\\n‘We shall see, we shall see,’ he repeated to himself.\\nBut no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled \\nupon Porfiry himself in the passage. He was coming in to \\nsee him. Raskolnikov was dumbfounded for a minute, but \\nonly for one minute. Strange to say, he was not very much \\nastonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of him. He \\nwas simply startled, but was quickly, instantly, on his guard. \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf645\\uf649\\n‘Perhaps this will mean the end? But how could Porfiry have \\napproached so quietly, like a cat, so that he had heard noth-\\ning? Could he have been listening at the door?’\\n‘You didn’t expect a visitor, Rodion Romanovitch,’ Por-\\nfiry explained, laughing. ‘I’ve been meaning to look in a \\nlong time; I was passing by and thought why not go in for \\nfive minutes. Are you going out? I won’t keep you long. Just \\nlet me have one cigarette.’\\n‘Sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down.’ Raskolnikov gave \\nhis visitor a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression \\nthat he would have marvelled at himself, if he could have \\nseen it.\\nThe last moment had come, the last drops had to be \\ndrained! So a man will sometimes go through half an hour \\nof mortal terror with a brigand, yet when the knife is at his \\nthroat at last, he feels no fear.\\nRaskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry, and \\nlooked at him without flinching. Porfiry screwed up his \\neyes and began lighting a cigarette.\\n‘Speak, speak,’ seemed as though it would burst from \\nRaskolnikov’s heart. ‘Come, why don’t you speak?’\\n\\uf649\\uf645\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter II\\n‘\\nAh these cigarettes!’ Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last, \\nhaving lighted one. ‘They are pernicious, positively perni-\\ncious, and yet I can’t give them up!

Everything is relative, Rodion \\nRomanovitch, everything is relative!’\\n‘Why, he’s playing his professional tricks again,’ Raskol-\\nnikov thought with disgust. All the circumstances of their \\nlast interview suddenly came back to him, and he felt a rush \\nof the feeling that had come upon him then.\\n‘I came to see you the day before yesterday, in the eve-\\nning; you didn’t know?’ Porfiry Petrovitch went on, looking \\nround the room. ‘I came into this very room. I was passing \\nby, just as I did to-day, and I thought I’d return your call. \\nI walked in as your door was wide open, I looked round, \\nwaited and went out without leaving my name with your \\nservant. Don’t you lock your door?’\\nRaskolnikov’s face grew more and more gloomy.

I owe you an explanation and must give it \\nto you,’ he continued with a slight smile, just patting Ras-\\nkolnikov’s knee.\\nBut almost at the same instant a serious and careworn \\nlook came into his face; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a \\ntouch of sadness in it. He had never seen and never suspect-\\ned such an expression in his face.\\n‘A strange scene passed between us last time we met, Ro-\\ndion Romanovitch. Our first interview, too, was a strange \\none; but then … and one thing after another! This is the \\npoint: I have perhaps acted unfairly to you; I feel it. Do you \\nremember how we parted? Your nerves were unhinged and \\nyour knees were shaking and so were mine. And, you know, \\nour behaviour was unseemly, even ungentlemanly. And yet \\nwe are gentlemen, above all, in any case, gentlemen; that \\nmust be understood. Do you remember what we came to? … \\nand it was quite indecorous.’\\n‘What is he up to, what does he take me for?’ Raskolnikov \\nasked himself in amazement, raising his head and looking \\nwith open eyes on Porfiry.\\n‘I’ve decided openness is better between us,’ Porfiry \\nPetrovitch went on, turning his head away and dropping \\nhis eyes, as though unwilling to disconcert his former vic-\\ntim and as though disdaining his former wiles. ‘Yes, such \\nsuspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long. Niko-\\nlay put a stop to it, or I don’t know what we might not have \\ncome to. That damned workman was sitting at the time in \\nthe next room—can you realise that? You know that, of \\n\\uf649\\uf645\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ncourse; and I am aware that he came to you afterwards. But \\nwhat you supposed then was not true: I had not sent for any-\\none, I had made no kind of arrangements. You ask why I \\nhadn’t? What shall I say to you? it had all come upon me so \\nsuddenly. I had scarcely sent for the porters (you noticed \\nthem as you went out, I dare say). An idea flashed upon me; \\nI was firmly convinced at the time, you see, Rodion Roma-\\nnovitch. Come, I thought—even if I let one thing slip for a \\ntime, I shall get hold of something else—I shan’t lose what \\nI want, anyway. You are nervously irritable, Rodion Roma-\\nnovitch, by temperament; it’s out of proportion with other \\nqualities of your heart and character, which I flatter myself \\nI have to some extent divined. Of course I did reflect even \\nthen that it does not always happen that a man gets up and \\nblurts out his whole story. It does happen sometimes, if you \\nmake a man lose all patience, though even then it’s rare. I \\nwas capable of realising that. If I only had a fact, I thought, \\nthe least little fact to go upon, something I could lay hold \\nof, something tangible, not merely psychological. For if a \\nman is guilty, you must be able to get something substantial \\nout of him; one may reckon upon most surprising results \\nindeed. I was reckoning on your temperament, Rodion Ro-\\nmanovitch, on your temperament above all things! I had \\ngreat hopes of you at that time.’\\n‘But what are you driving at now?’ Raskolnikov muttered \\nat last, asking the question without thinking.',\n",
              " '‘What is he talking about?’ he wondered distractedly, \\n‘does he really take me to be innocent?’\\n‘What am I driving at? I’ve come to explain myself, I con-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf6460\\nsider it my duty, so to speak. I want to make clear to you how \\nthe whole business, the whole misunderstanding arose. I’ve \\ncaused you a great deal of suffering, Rodion Romanovitch. \\nI am not a monster. I understand what it must mean for a \\nman who has been unfortunate, but who is proud, imperi-\\nous and above all, impatient, to have to bear such treatment! \\nI regard you in any case as a man of noble character and \\nnot without elements of magnanimity, though I don’t agree \\nwith all your convictions. I wanted to tell you this first, \\nfrankly and quite sincerely, for above all I don’t want to de-\\nceive you. When I made your acquaintance, I felt attracted \\nby you. Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so. You have a \\nright to. I know you disliked me from the first and indeed \\nyou’ve no reason to like me. You may think what you like, \\nbut I desire now to do all I can to efface that impression and \\nto show that I am a man of heart and conscience. I speak \\nsincerely.’\\nPorfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause. Raskolnikov \\nfelt a rush of renewed alarm. The thought that Porfiry be-\\nlieved him to be innocent began to make him uneasy.\\n‘It’s scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail,’ \\nPorfiry Petrovitch went on. ‘Indeed, I could scarcely attempt \\nit. To begin with there were rumours. Through whom, how, \\nand when those rumours came to me … and how they af-\\nfected you, I need not go into. My suspicions were aroused \\nby a complete accident, which might just as easily not have \\nhappened. What was it? Hm! I believe there is no need to \\ngo into that either. Those rumours and that accident led to \\none idea in my mind. I admit it openly—for one may as well \\n\\uf649\\uf6461\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nmake a clean breast of it—I was the first to pitch on you. The \\nold woman’s notes on the pledges and the rest of it—that all \\ncame to nothing. Yours was one of a hundred. I happened, \\ntoo, to hear of the scene at the office, from a man who de-\\nscribed it capitally, unconsciously reproducing the scene \\nwith great vividness. It was just one thing after another, Ro-\\ndion Romanovitch, my dear fellow! How could I avoid being \\nbrought to certain ideas? From a hundred rabbits you can’t \\nmake a horse, a hundred suspicions don’t make a proof, as \\nthe English proverb says, but that’s only from the rational \\npoint of view—you can’t help being partial, for after all a \\nlawyer is only human. I thought, too, of your article in that \\njournal, do you remember, on your first visit we talked of \\nit? I jeered at you at the time, but that was only to lead you \\non. I repeat, Rodion Romanovitch, you are ill and impatient. \\nThat you were bold, headstrong, in earnest and … had felt a \\ngreat deal I recognised long before. I, too, have felt the same, \\nso that your article seemed familiar to me. It was conceived \\non sleepless nights, with a throbbing heart, in ecstasy and \\nsuppressed enthusiasm. And that proud suppressed enthu-\\nsiasm in young people is dangerous! I jeered at you then, \\nbut let me tell you that, as a literary amateur, I am awfully \\nfond of such first essays, full of the heat of youth. There is \\na mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist. Your article \\nis absurd and fantastic, but there’s a transparent sincerity, a \\nyouthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it. \\nIt’s a gloomy article, but that’s what’s fine in it. I read your \\narticle and put it aside, thinking as I did so ‘that man won’t \\ngo the common way.’ Well, I ask you, after that as a prelimi-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf646\\uf645\\nnary, how could I help being carried away by what followed? \\nOh, dear, I am not saying anything, I am not making any \\nstatement now. I simply noted it at the time.',\n",
              " 'What is there \\nin it? I reflected. There’s nothing in it, that is really noth-\\ning and perhaps absolutely nothing. And it’s not at all the \\nthing for the prosecutor to let himself be carried away by \\nnotions: here I have Nikolay on my hands with actual evi-\\ndence against him—you may think what you like of it, but \\nit’s evidence. He brings in his psychology, too; one has to \\nconsider him, too, for it’s a matter of life and death. Why \\nam I explaining this to you? That you may understand, and \\nnot blame my malicious behaviour on that occasion. It was \\nnot malicious, I assure you, he-he! Do you suppose I didn’t \\ncome to search your room at the time? I did, I did, he-he! I \\nwas here when you were lying ill in bed, not officially, not in \\nmy own person, but I was here. Your room was searched to \\nthe last thread at the first suspicion; but umsonst! I thought \\nto myself, now that man will come, will come of himself \\nand quickly, too; if he’s guilty, he’s sure to come. Anoth-\\ner man wouldn’t, but he will. And you remember how Mr. \\nRazumihin began discussing the subject with you? We ar-\\nranged that to excite you, so we purposely spread rumours, \\nthat he might discuss the case with you, and Razumihin \\nis not a man to restrain his indignation. Mr. Zametov was \\ntremendously struck by your anger and your open daring. \\nThink of blurting out in a restaurant ‘I killed her.’ It was too \\ndaring, too reckless. I thought so myself, if he is guilty he \\nwill be a formidable opponent. That was what I thought at \\nthe time. I was expecting you. But you simply bowled Za-\\n\\uf649\\uf646\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nmetov over and … well, you see, it all lies in this—that this \\ndamnable psychology can be taken two ways! Well, I kept \\nexpecting you, and so it was, you came! My heart was fairly \\nthrobbing. Ach!\\n‘Now, why need you have come? Your laughter, too, as \\nyou came in, do you remember? I saw it all plain as daylight, \\nbut if I hadn’t expected you so specially, I should not have \\nnoticed anything in your laughter. You see what influence a \\nmood has! Mr. Razumihin then—ah, that stone, that stone \\nunder which the things were hidden! I seem to see it some-\\nwhere in a kitchen garden. It was in a kitchen garden, you \\ntold Zametov and afterwards you repeated that in my office? \\nAnd when we began picking your article to pieces, how you \\nexplained it! One could take every word of yours in two \\nsenses, as though there were another meaning hidden.\\n‘So in this way, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached the fur-\\nthest limit, and knocking my head against a post, I pulled \\nmyself up, asking myself what I was about. After all, I said, \\nyou can take it all in another sense if you like, and it’s more \\nnatural so, indeed. I couldn’t help admitting it was more \\nnatural. I was bothered! ‘No, I’d better get hold of some lit-\\ntle fact’ I said. So when I heard of the bell-ringing, I held \\nmy breath and was all in a tremor. ‘Here is my little fact,’ \\nthought I, and I didn’t think it over, I simply wouldn’t. I \\nwould have given a thousand roubles at that minute to have \\nseen you with my own eyes, when you walked a hundred \\npaces beside that workman, after he had called you murder-\\ner to your face, and you did not dare to ask him a question \\nall the way. And then what about your trembling, what \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf646\\uf647\\nabout your bell-ringing in your illness, in semi-delirium?\\n‘And so, Rodion Romanovitch, can you wonder that I \\nplayed such pranks on you? And what made you come at \\nthat very minute? Someone seemed to have sent you, by Jove! \\nAnd if Nikolay had not parted us … and do you remember \\nNikolay at the time? Do you remember him clearly? It was \\na thunderbolt, a regular thunderbolt! And how I met him! \\nI didn’t believe in the thunderbolt, not for a minute. You \\ncould see it for yourself; and how could I? Even afterwards, \\nwhen you had gone and he began making very, very plausi-\\nble answers on certain points, so that I was surprised at him \\nmyself, even then I didn’t believe his story! You see what it \\nis to be as firm as a rock! No, thought I, Morgenfrüh. What \\nhas Nikolay got to do with it!’\\n‘Razumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay \\nguilty and had yourself assured him of it….’\\nHis voice failed him, and he broke off. He had been lis-\\ntening in indescribable agitation, as this man who had seen \\nthrough and through him, went back upon himself. He was \\nafraid of believing it and did not believe it. In those still am-\\nbiguous words he kept eagerly looking for something more \\ndefinite and conclusive.\\n‘Mr. Razumihin!’ cried Porfiry Petrovitch, seeming glad \\nof a question from Raskolnikov, who had till then been si-\\nlent. ‘He-he-he!

Believe me, it will be better, \\nRodion Romanovitch.’\\nRaskolnikov smiled malignantly.\\n‘That’s not simply ridiculous, it’s positively shameless. \\nWhy, even if I were guilty, which I don’t admit, what reason \\nshould I have to confess, when you tell me yourself that I \\nshall be in greater safety in prison?’\\n‘Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, don’t put too much faith in \\nwords, perhaps prison will not be altogether a restful place. \\nThat’s only theory and my theory, and what authority am \\nI for you? Perhaps, too, even now I am hiding something \\n\\uf649\\uf6471\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nfrom you? I can’t lay bare everything, he-he! And how can \\nyou ask what advantage? Don’t you know how it would less-\\nen your sentence? You would be confessing at a moment \\nwhen another man has taken the crime on himself and so \\nhas muddled the whole case. Consider that! I swear before \\nGod that I will so arrange that your confession shall come \\nas a complete surprise. We will make a clean sweep of all \\nthese psychological points, of a suspicion against you, so \\nthat your crime will appear to have been something like an \\naberration, for in truth it was an aberration. I am an honest \\nman, Rodion Romanovitch, and will keep my word.’\\nRaskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his \\nhead sink dejectedly. He pondered a long while and at last \\nsmiled again, but his smile was sad and gentle.\\n‘No!’ he said, apparently abandoning all attempt to keep \\nup appearances with Porfiry, ‘it’s not worth it, I don’t care \\nabout lessening the sentence!’\\n‘That’s just what I was afraid of!’ Porfiry cried warmly \\nand, as it seemed, involuntarily. ‘That’s just what I feared, \\nthat you wouldn’t care about the mitigation of sentence.’\\nRaskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him.\\n‘Ah, don’t disdain life!’ Porfiry went on. ‘You have a great \\ndeal of it still before you. How can you say you don’t want a \\nmitigation of sentence? You are an impatient fellow!’\\n‘A great deal of what lies before me?’\\n‘Of life. What sort of prophet are you, do you know much \\nabout it? Seek and ye shall find. This may be God’s means \\nfor bringing you to Him. And it’s not for ever, the bond-\\nage….’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf647\\uf645\\n‘The time will be shortened,’ laughed Raskolnikov.\\n‘Why, is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of? It \\nmay be that you are afraid of it without knowing it, because \\nyou are young! But anyway you shouldn’t be afraid of giving \\nyourself up and confessing.’\\n‘Ach, hang it!’ Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and \\ncontempt, as though he did not want to speak aloud.\\nHe got up again as though he meant to go away, but sat \\ndown again in evident despair.\\n‘Hang it, if you like! You’ve lost faith and you think that \\nI am grossly flattering you; but how long has your life been? \\nHow much do you understand? You made up a theory and \\nthen were ashamed that it broke down and turned out to be \\nnot at all original! It turned out something base, that’s true, \\nbut you are not hopelessly base. By no means so base! At \\nleast you didn’t deceive yourself for long, you went straight \\nto the furthest point at one bound. How do I regard you? I \\nregard you as one of those men who would stand and smile \\nat their torturer while he cuts their entrails out, if only they \\nhave found faith or God. Find it and you will live.

I know \\nyou don’t believe in it—but don’t be over-wise; fling yourself \\nstraight into life, without deliberation; don’t be afraid—the \\nflood will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your \\nfeet again. What bank? How can I tell? I only believe that \\nyou have long life before you.

Think \\nit over, my dear fellow, and pray to God. It’s more in your \\ninterest, believe me.’\\n‘And what if I run away?’ asked Raskolnikov with a \\nstrange smile.\\n‘No, you won’t run away. A peasant would run away, a \\nfashionable dissenter would run away, the flunkey of anoth-\\ner man’s thought, for you’ve only to show him the end of \\nyour little finger and he’ll be ready to believe in anything for \\nthe rest of his life. But you’ve ceased to believe in your the-\\nory already, what will you run away with? And what would \\nyou do in hiding? It would be hateful and difficult for you, \\nand what you need more than anything in life is a definite \\nposition, an atmosphere to suit you. And what sort of atmo-\\nsphere would you have? If you ran away, you’d come back \\nto yourself. You can’t get on without us. And if I put you in \\nprison—say you’ve been there a month, or two, or three—\\nremember my word, you’ll confess of yourself and perhaps \\nto your own surprise.

What he had to hope from \\nthat man he did not know. But that man had some hid-\\nden power over him. Having once recognised this, he could \\nnot rest, and now the time had come.\\nOn the way, one question particularly worried him: had \\nSvidrigaïlov been to Porfiry’s?\\nAs far as he could judge, he would swear to it, that he had \\nnot. He pondered again and again, went over Porfiry’s visit; \\nno, he hadn’t been, of course he hadn’t.\\nBut if he had not been yet, would he go? Meanwhile, for \\nthe present he fancied he couldn’t. Why? He could not have \\nexplained, but if he could, he would not have wasted much \\nthought over it at the moment. It all worried him and at the \\nsame time he could not attend to it. Strange to say, none \\nwould have believed it perhaps, but he only felt a faint vague \\nanxiety about his immediate future. Another, much more \\nimportant anxiety tormented him—it concerned himself, \\nbut in a different, more vital way. Moreover, he was con-\\nscious of immense moral fatigue, though his mind was \\nworking better that morning than it had done of late.\\nAnd was it worth while, after all that had happened, to \\ncontend with these new trivial difficulties? Was it worth \\nwhile, for instance, to manœuvre that Svidrigaïlov should \\nnot go to Porfiry’s? Was it worth while to investigate, to \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf647\\uf64b\\nascertain the facts, to waste time over anyone like Svidriga-\\nïlov?\\nOh, how sick he was of it all!\\nAnd yet he was hastening to Svidrigaïlov; could he be ex-\\npecting something new from him, information, or means of \\nescape? Men will catch at straws! Was it destiny or some in-\\nstinct bringing them together? Perhaps it was only fatigue, \\ndespair; perhaps it was not Svidrigaïlov but some other \\nwhom he needed, and Svidrigaïlov had simply presented \\nhimself by chance. Sonia? But what should he go to Sonia \\nfor now? To beg her tears again? He was afraid of Sonia, too. \\nSonia stood before him as an irrevocable sentence.',\n",
              " 'He must \\ngo his own way or hers. At that moment especially he did \\nnot feel equal to seeing her. No, would it not be better to try \\nSvidrigaïlov? And he could not help inwardly owning that \\nhe had long felt that he must see him for some reason.\\nBut what could they have in common? Their very evil-\\ndoing could not be of the same kind. The man, moreover, \\nwas very unpleasant, evidently depraved, undoubtedly cun-\\nning and deceitful, possibly malignant. Such stories were \\ntold about him. It is true he was befriending Katerina Iva-\\nnovna’s children, but who could tell with what motive and \\nwhat it meant? The man always had some design, some proj-\\nect.\\nThere was another thought which had been continually \\nhovering of late about Raskolnikov’s mind, and causing him \\ngreat uneasiness. It was so painful that he made distinct ef-\\nforts to get rid of it. He sometimes thought that Svidrigaïlov \\nwas dogging his footsteps. Svidrigaïlov had found out his \\n\\uf649\\uf647\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nsecret and had had designs on Dounia. What if he had them \\nstill? Wasn’t it practically certain that he had? And what if, \\nhaving learnt his secret and so having gained power over \\nhim, he were to use it as a weapon against Dounia?\\nThis idea sometimes even tormented his dreams, but it \\nhad never presented itself so vividly to him as on his way to \\nSvidrigaïlov. The very thought moved him to gloomy rage. \\nTo begin with, this would transform everything, even his \\nown position; he would have at once to confess his secret to \\nDounia. Would he have to give himself up perhaps to pre-\\nvent Dounia from taking some rash step? The letter? This \\nmorning Dounia had received a letter. From whom could \\nshe get letters in Petersburg? Luzhin, perhaps? It’s true Ra-\\nzumihin was there to protect her, but Razumihin knew \\nnothing of the position. Perhaps it was his duty to tell Razu-\\nmihin? He thought of it with repugnance.\\nIn any case he must see Svidrigaïlov as soon as possible, \\nhe decided finally. Thank God, the details of the interview \\nwere of little consequence, if only he could get at the root of \\nthe matter; but if Svidrigaïlov were capable … if he were in-\\ntriguing against Dounia— then …\\nRaskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed \\nthrough that month that he could only decide such ques-\\ntions in one way; ‘then I shall kill him,’ he thought in cold \\ndespair.\\nA sudden anguish oppressed his heart, he stood still in \\nthe middle of the street and began looking about to see \\nwhere he was and which way he was going. He found himself \\nin X. Prospect, thirty or forty paces from the Hay Market, \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf6480\\nthrough which he had come. The whole second storey of \\nthe house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows \\nwere wide open; judging from the figures moving at the \\nwindows, the rooms were full to overflowing. There were \\nsounds of singing, of clarionet and violin, and the boom of \\na Turkish drum. He could hear women shrieking. He was \\nabout to turn back wondering why he had come to the X. \\nProspect, when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw \\nSvidrigaïlov, sitting at a tea-table right in the open window \\nwith a pipe in his mouth. Raskolnikov was dreadfully taken \\naback, almost terrified. Svidrigaïlov was silently watching \\nand scrutinising him and, what struck Raskolnikov at once, \\nseemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved. \\nRaskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him, but \\nto be looking absent-mindedly away, while he watched him \\nout of the corner of his eye. His heart was beating violently. \\nYet, it was evident that Svidrigaïlov did not want to be seen. \\nHe took the pipe out of his mouth and was on the point of \\nconcealing himself, but as he got up and moved back his \\nchair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Ras-\\nkolnikov had seen him, and was watching him. What had \\npassed between them was much the same as what happened \\nat their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room. A sly smile \\ncame into Svidrigaïlov’s face and grew broader and broader. \\nEach knew that he was seen and watched by the other. At \\nlast Svidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh.\\n‘Well, well, come in if you want me; I am here!’ he shout-\\ned from the window.',\n",
              " 'Raskolnikov went up into the tavern. He found Svid-\\n\\uf649\\uf6481\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nrigaïlov in a tiny back room, adjoining the saloon in which \\nmerchants, clerks and numbers of people of all sorts were \\ndrinking tea at twenty little tables to the desperate bawl-\\ning of a chorus of singers. The click of billiard balls could \\nbe heard in the distance. On the table before Svidrigaïlov \\nstood an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. In \\nthe room he found also a boy with a little hand organ, a \\nhealthy-looking red- cheeked girl of eighteen, wearing a \\ntucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with ribbons. In \\nspite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some \\nservants’ hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the ac-\\ncompaniment of the organ.\\n‘Come, that’s enough,’ Svidrigaïlov stopped her at Ras-\\nkolnikov’s entrance. The girl at once broke off and stood \\nwaiting respectfully. She had sung her guttural rhymes, too, \\nwith a serious and respectful expression in her face.\\n‘Hey, Philip, a glass!’ shouted Svidrigaïlov.\\n‘I won’t drink anything,’ said Raskolnikov.\\n‘As you like, I didn’t mean it for you. Drink, Katia! I don’t \\nwant anything more to-day, you can go.’ He poured her out \\na full glass, and laid down a yellow note.\\nKatia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without \\nputting it down, in twenty gulps, took the note and kissed \\nSvidrigaïlov’s hand, which he allowed quite seriously. She \\nwent out of the room and the boy trailed after her with \\nthe organ. Both had been brought in from the street. Svid-\\nrigaïlov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything \\nabout him was already, so to speak, on a patriarchal foot-\\ning; the waiter, Philip, was by now an old friend and very \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf648\\uf645\\nobsequious.\\nThe door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. Svidriga-\\nïlov was at home in this room and perhaps spent whole days \\nin it. The tavern was dirty and wretched, not even second-\\nrate.\\n‘I was going to see you and looking for you,’ Raskol-\\nnikov began, ‘but I don’t know what made me turn from \\nthe Hay Market into the X. Prospect just now. I never take \\nthis turning. I turn to the right from the Hay Market. And \\nthis isn’t the way to you. I simply turned and here you are. \\nIt is strange!’\\n‘Why don’t you say at once ‘it’s a miracle’?’\\n‘Because it may be only chance.’\\n‘Oh, that’s the way with all you folk,’ laughed Svidriga-\\nïlov. ‘You won’t admit it, even if you do inwardly believe it a \\nmiracle! Here you say that it may be only chance. And what \\ncowards they all are here, about having an opinion of their \\nown, you can’t fancy, Rodion Romanovitch. I don’t mean \\nyou, you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to \\nhave it. That’s how it was you attracted my curiosity.’\\n‘Nothing else?’\\n‘Well, that’s enough, you know,’ Svidrigaïlov was obvi-\\nously exhilarated, but only slightly so, he had not had more \\nthan half a glass of wine.\\n‘I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was \\ncapable of having what you call an opinion of my own,’ ob-\\nserved Raskolnikov.\\n‘Oh, well, it was a different matter. everyone has his own \\nplans. And apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I \\n\\uf649\\uf648\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthink you have been asleep for the last two or three days.',\n",
              " 'I told you of this tavern myself, there is no miracle in your \\ncoming straight here. I explained the way myself, told you \\nwhere it was, and the hours you could find me here. Do you \\nremember?’\\n‘I don’t remember,’ answered Raskolnikov with surprise.\\n‘I believe you. I told you twice. The address has been \\nstamped mechanically on your memory. You turned this \\nway mechanically and yet precisely according to the di-\\nrection, though you are not aware of it. When I told you \\nthen, I hardly hoped you understood me. You give your-\\nself away too much, Rodion Romanovitch. And another \\nthing, I’m convinced there are lots of people in Petersburg \\nwho talk to themselves as they walk. This is a town of crazy \\npeople. If only we had scientific men, doctors, lawyers and \\nphilosophers might make most valuable investigations in \\nPetersburg each in his own line. There are few places where \\nthere are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on \\nthe soul of man as in Petersburg. The mere influences of cli-\\nmate mean so much. And it’s the administrative centre of \\nall Russia and its character must be reflected on the whole \\ncountry. But that is neither here nor there now. The point \\nis that I have several times watched you. You walk out of \\nyour house—holding your head high—twenty paces from \\nhome you let it sink, and fold your hands behind your back. \\nYou look and evidently see nothing before nor beside you. \\nAt last you begin moving your lips and talking to yourself, \\nand sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at last \\nstand still in the middle of the road. That’s not at all the \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf648\\uf647\\nthing. Someone may be watching you besides me, and it \\nwon’t do you any good. It’s nothing really to do with me and \\nI can’t cure you, but, of course, you understand me.’\\n‘Do you know that I am being followed?’ asked Raskol-\\nnikov, looking inquisitively at him.\\n‘No, I know nothing about it,’ said Svidrigaïlov, seeming \\nsurprised.\\n‘Well, then, let us leave me alone,’ Raskolnikov muttered, \\nfrowning.\\n‘Very good, let us leave you alone.’\\n‘You had better tell me, if you come here to drink, and di-\\nrected me twice to come here to you, why did you hide, and \\ntry to get away just now when I looked at the window from \\nthe street? I saw it.’\\n‘He-he! And why was it you lay on your sofa with closed \\neyes and pretended to be asleep, though you were wide \\nawake while I stood in your doorway? I saw it.’\\n‘I may have had … reasons. You know that yourself.’\\n‘And I may have had my reasons, though you don’t know \\nthem.’\\nRaskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table, leaned \\nhis chin in the fingers of his right hand, and stared intent-\\nly at Svidrigaïlov. For a full minute he scrutinised his face, \\nwhich had impressed him before. It was a strange face, like \\na mask; white and red, with bright red lips, with a flaxen \\nbeard, and still thick flaxen hair. His eyes were somehow \\ntoo blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed. \\nThere was something awfully unpleasant in that handsome \\nface, which looked so wonderfully young for his age. Svid-\\n\\uf649\\uf648\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nrigaïlov was smartly dressed in light summer clothes and \\nwas particularly dainty in his linen. He wore a huge ring \\nwith a precious stone in it.',\n",
              " '‘Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?’ said \\nRaskolnikov suddenly, coming with nervous impatience \\nstraight to the point. ‘Even though perhaps you are the most \\ndangerous man if you care to injure me, I don’t want to put \\nmyself out any more. I will show you at once that I don’t \\nprize myself as you probably think I do. I’ve come to tell \\nyou at once that if you keep to your former intentions with \\nregard to my sister and if you think to derive any benefit in \\nthat direction from what has been discovered of late, I will \\nkill you before you get me locked up. You can reckon on my \\nword. You know that I can keep it. And in the second place \\nif you want to tell me anything —for I keep fancying all \\nthis time that you have something to tell me—make haste \\nand tell it, for time is precious and very likely it will soon \\nbe too late.’\\n‘Why in such haste?’ asked Svidrigaïlov, looking at him \\ncuriously.\\n‘Everyone has his plans,’ Raskolnikov answered gloomily \\nand impatiently.\\n‘You urged me yourself to frankness just now, and at the \\nfirst question you refuse to answer,’ Svidrigaïlov observed \\nwith a smile. ‘You keep fancying that I have aims of my own \\nand so you look at me with suspicion. Of course it’s perfect-\\nly natural in your position. But though I should like to be \\nfriends with you, I shan’t trouble myself to convince you of \\nthe contrary. The game isn’t worth the candle and I wasn’t \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf648\\uf649\\nintending to talk to you about anything special.’\\n‘What did you want me, for, then? It was you who came \\nhanging about me.’\\n‘Why, simply as an interesting subject for observation. I \\nliked the fantastic nature of your position—that’s what it \\nwas! Besides you are the brother of a person who greatly in-\\nterested me, and from that person I had in the past heard a \\nvery great deal about you, from which I gathered that you \\nhad a great influence over her; isn’t that enough? Ha-ha-ha! \\nStill I must admit that your question is rather complex, and \\nis difficult for me to answer. Here, you, for instance, have \\ncome to me not only for a definite object, but for the sake of \\nhearing something new. Isn’t that so? Isn’t that so?’ persist-\\ned Svidrigaïlov with a sly smile. ‘Well, can’t you fancy then \\nthat I, too, on my way here in the train was reckoning on \\nyou, on your telling me something new, and on my making \\nsome profit out of you! You see what rich men we are!’\\n‘What profit could you make?’\\n‘How can I tell you? How do I know? You see in what \\na tavern I spend all my time and it’s my enjoyment, that’s \\nto say it’s no great enjoyment, but one must sit somewhere; \\nthat poor Katia now—you saw her? … If only I had been a \\nglutton now, a club gourmand, but you see I can eat this.’\\nHe pointed to a little table in the corner where the rem-\\nnants of a terrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a \\ntin dish.\\n‘Have you dined, by the way? I’ve had something and \\nwant nothing more. I don’t drink, for instance, at all. Ex-\\ncept for champagne I never touch anything, and not more \\n\\uf649\\uf648\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthan a glass of that all the evening, and even that is enough \\nto make my head ache. I ordered it just now to wind my-\\nself up, for I am just going off somewhere and you see me \\nin a peculiar state of mind. That was why I hid myself just \\nnow like a schoolboy, for I was afraid you would hinder me. \\nBut I believe,’ he pulled out his watch, ‘I can spend an hour \\nwith you. It’s half-past four now. If only I’d been something, \\na landowner, a father, a cavalry officer, a photographer, a \\njournalist … I am nothing, no specialty, and sometimes \\nI am positively bored. I really thought you would tell me \\nsomething new.’\\n‘But what are you, and why have you come here?’\\n‘What am I? You know, a gentleman, I served for two \\nyears in the cavalry, then I knocked about here in Pe-\\ntersburg, then I married Marfa Petrovna and lived in the \\ncountry. There you have my biography!’\\n‘You are a gambler, I believe?’\\n‘No, a poor sort of gambler. A card-sharper—not a gam-\\nbler.’\\n‘You have been a card-sharper then?’\\n‘Yes, I’ve been a card-sharper too.’\\n‘Didn’t you get thrashed sometimes?’\\n‘It did happen. Why?’\\n‘Why, you might have challenged them … altogether it \\nmust have been lively.’\\n‘I won’t contradict you, and besides I am no hand at phi-\\nlosophy. I confess that I hastened here for the sake of the \\nwomen.’\\n‘As soon as you buried Marfa Petrovna?’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf648\\uf64b\\n‘Quite so,’ Svidrigaïlov smiled with engaging candour.',\n",
              " '‘What of it? You seem to find something wrong in my speak-\\ning like that about women?’\\n‘You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?’\\n‘Vice! Oh, that’s what you are after! But I’ll answer you \\nin order, first about women in general; you know I am fond \\nof talking. Tell me, what should I restrain myself for? Why \\nshould I give up women, since I have a passion for them? It’s \\nan occupation, anyway.’\\n‘So you hope for nothing here but vice?’\\n‘Oh, very well, for vice then. You insist on its being vice. \\nBut anyway I like a direct question. In this vice at least there \\nis something permanent, founded indeed upon nature and \\nnot dependent on fantasy, something present in the blood \\nlike an ever-burning ember, for ever setting one on fire and, \\nmaybe, not to be quickly extinguished, even with years. \\nYou’ll agree it’s an occupation of a sort.’\\n‘That’s nothing to rejoice at, it’s a disease and a danger-\\nous one.’\\n‘Oh, that’s what you think, is it! I agree, that it is a disease \\nlike everything that exceeds moderation. And, of course, \\nin this one must exceed moderation. But in the first place, \\neverybody does so in one way or another, and in the sec-\\nond place, of course, one ought to be moderate and prudent, \\nhowever mean it may be, but what am I to do? If I hadn’t \\nthis, I might have to shoot myself. I am ready to admit that \\na decent man ought to put up with being bored, but yet …’\\n‘And could you shoot yourself?’\\n‘Oh, come!’ Svidrigaïlov parried with disgust. ‘Please \\n\\uf649\\uf648\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ndon’t speak of it,’ he added hurriedly and with none of the \\nbragging tone he had shown in all the previous conversa-\\ntion. His face quite changed. ‘I admit it’s an unpardonable \\nweakness, but I can’t help it. I am afraid of death and I dis-\\nlike its being talked of. Do you know that I am to a certain \\nextent a mystic?’\\n‘Ah, the apparitions of Marfa Petrovna! Do they still go \\non visiting you?’\\n‘Oh, don’t talk of them; there have been no more in Pe-\\ntersburg, confound them!’ he cried with an air of irritation. \\n‘Let’s rather talk of that … though … H’m!

No, that’s not what I \\nwant to talk of.’\\n‘And the hideousness, the filthiness of all your surround-\\nings, doesn’t that affect you? Have you lost the strength to \\nstop yourself?’\\n‘And do you pretend to strength, too? He-he-he! You sur-\\nprised me just now, Rodion Romanovitch, though I knew \\nbeforehand it would be so. You preach to me about vice \\nand æsthetics! You—a Schiller, you—an idealist! Of course \\nthat’s all as it should be and it would be surprising if it were \\nnot so, yet it is strange in reality…. Ah, what a pity I have \\nno time, for you’re a most interesting type! And, by-the-way, \\nare you fond of Schiller? I am awfully fond of him.’\\n‘But what a braggart you are,’ Raskolnikov said with \\nsome disgust.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf6490\\n‘Upon my word, I am not,’ answered Svidrigaïlov laugh-\\ning. ‘However, I won’t dispute it, let me be a braggart, why \\nnot brag, if it hurts no one? I spent seven years in the coun-\\ntry with Marfa Petrovna, so now when I come across an \\nintelligent person like you—intelligent and highly interest-\\ning—I am simply glad to talk and, besides, I’ve drunk that \\nhalf-glass of champagne and it’s gone to my head a little. \\nAnd besides, there’s a certain fact that has wound me up tre-\\nmendously, but about that I … will keep quiet. Where are \\nyou off to?’ he asked in alarm.\\nRaskolnikov had begun getting up. He felt oppressed \\nand stifled and, as it were, ill at ease at having come here. \\nHe felt convinced that Svidrigaïlov was the most worthless \\nscoundrel on the face of the earth.\\n‘A-ach! Sit down, stay a little!’ Svidrigaïlov begged. ‘Let \\nthem bring you some tea, anyway. Stay a little, I won’t talk \\nnonsense, about myself, I mean. I’ll tell you something. If \\nyou like I’ll tell you how a woman tried ‘to save’ me, as you \\nwould call it? It will be an answer to your first question in-\\ndeed, for the woman was your sister. May I tell you? It will \\nhelp to spend the time.’\\n‘Tell me, but I trust that you …’\\n‘Oh, don’t be uneasy. Besides, even in a worthless low \\nfellow like me, Avdotya Romanovna can only excite the \\ndeepest respect.',\n",

There’s no need to go into particulars how Marfa \\nPetrovna bought me out; do you know to what a point of \\ninsanity a woman can sometimes love? She was an honest \\nwoman, and very sensible, although completely uneducat-\\ned. Would you believe that this honest and jealous woman, \\nafter many scenes of hysterics and reproaches, condescend-\\ned to enter into a kind of contract with me which she kept \\nthroughout our married life? She was considerably older \\nthan I, and besides, she always kept a clove or something \\nin her mouth. There was so much swinishness in my soul \\nand honesty too, of a sort, as to tell her straight out that I \\ncouldn’t be absolutely faithful to her. This confession drove \\nher to frenzy, but yet she seems in a way to have liked my \\nbrutal frankness. She thought it showed I was unwilling \\nto deceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for \\na jealous woman, you know, that’s the first consideration. \\nAfter many tears an unwritten contract was drawn up be-\\ntween us: first, that I would never leave Marfa Petrovna and \\nwould always be her husband; secondly, that I would never \\nabsent myself without her permission; thirdly, that I would \\nnever set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf649\\uf645\\nthis, Marfa Petrovna gave me a free hand with the maid-\\nservants, but only with her secret knowledge; fifthly, God \\nforbid my falling in love with a woman of our class; sixthly, \\nin case I—which God forbid—should be visited by a great \\nserious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna. \\nOn this last score, however, Marfa Petrovna was fairly at \\nease. She was a sensible woman and so she could not help \\nlooking upon me as a dissolute profligate incapable of real \\nlove. But a sensible woman and a jealous woman are two \\nvery different things, and that’s where the trouble came in. \\nBut to judge some people impartially we must renounce \\ncertain preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to \\nthe ordinary people about us. I have reason to have faith in \\nyour judgment rather than in anyone’s. Perhaps you have \\nalready heard a great deal that was ridiculous and absurd \\nabout Marfa Petrovna. She certainly had some very ridicu-\\nlous ways, but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for \\nthe innumerable woes of which I was the cause. Well, and \\nthat’s enough, I think, by way of a decorous oraison funèbre \\nfor the most tender wife of a most tender husband. When \\nwe quarrelled, I usually held my tongue and did not irritate \\nher and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to attain its \\nobject, it influenced her, it pleased her, indeed. These were \\ntimes when she was positively proud of me. But your sister \\nshe couldn’t put up with, anyway. And however she came \\nto risk taking such a beautiful creature into her house as a \\ngoverness. My explanation is that Marfa Petrovna was an \\nardent and impressionable woman and simply fell in love \\nherself—literally fell in love—with your sister. Well, little \\n\\uf649\\uf649\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nwonder—look at Avdotya Romanovna! I saw the danger at \\nthe first glance and what do you think, I resolved not to \\nlook at her even. But Avdotya Romanovna herself made the \\nfirst step, would you believe it? Would you believe it too that \\nMarfa Petrovna was positively angry with me at first for my \\npersistent silence about your sister, for my careless reception \\nof her continual adoring praises of Avdotya Romanovna. I \\ndon’t know what it was she wanted! Well, of course, Mar-\\nfa Petrovna told Avdotya Romanovna every detail about \\nme. She had the unfortunate habit of telling literally every-\\none all our family secrets and continually complaining of \\nme; how could she fail to confide in such a delightful new \\nfriend? I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no \\ndoubt Avdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious \\nrumours that were current about me…. I don’t mind betting \\nthat you too have heard something of the sort already?’\\n‘I have. Luzhin charged you with having caused the death \\nof a child. Is that true?’\\n‘Don’t refer to those vulgar tales, I beg,’ said Svidriga-\\nïlov with disgust and annoyance. ‘If you insist on wanting \\nto know about all that idiocy, I will tell you one day, but \\nnow …’\\n‘I was told too about some footman of yours in the coun-\\ntry whom you treated badly.’\\n‘I beg you to drop the subject,’ Svidrigaïlov interrupted \\nagain with obvious impatience.\\n‘Was that the footman who came to you after death to fill \\nyour pipe? … you told me about it yourself.’ Raskolnikov \\nfelt more and more irritated.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf649\\uf647\\nSvidrigaïlov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov \\nfancied he caught a flash of spiteful mockery in that look. \\nBut Svidrigaïlov restrained himself and answered very civ-\\nilly:\\n‘Yes, it was. I see that you, too, are extremely interested \\nand shall feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first \\nopportunity. Upon my soul! I see that I really might pass \\nfor a romantic figure with some people. Judge how grateful \\nI must be to Marfa Petrovna for having repeated to Avdotya \\nRomanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip about \\nme. I dare not guess what impression it made on her, but \\nin any case it worked in my interests. With all Avdotya Ro-\\nmanovna’s natural aversion and in spite of my invariably \\ngloomy and repellent aspect—she did at least feel pity for \\nme, pity for a lost soul.',\n",
              " 'And if once a girl’s heart is moved \\nto pity it’s more dangerous than anything. She is bound to \\nwant to ‘save him,’ to bring him to his senses, and lift him \\nup and draw him to nobler aims, and restore him to new \\nlife and usefulness—well, we all know how far such dreams \\ncan go. I saw at once that the bird was flying into the cage \\nof herself. And I too made ready. I think you are frowning, \\nRodion Romanovitch? There’s no need. As you know, it all \\nended in smoke. (Hang it all, what a lot I am drinking!) Do \\nyou know, I always, from the very beginning, regretted that \\nit wasn’t your sister’s fate to be born in the second or third \\ncentury A.D., as the daughter of a reigning prince or some \\ngovernor or pro-consul in Asia Minor. She would undoubt-\\nedly have been one of those who would endure martyrdom \\nand would have smiled when they branded her bosom with \\n\\uf649\\uf649\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nhot pincers. And she would have gone to it of herself. And \\nin the fourth or fifth century she would have walked away \\ninto the Egyptian desert and would have stayed there thirty \\nyears living on roots and ecstasies and visions. She is simply \\nthirsting to face some torture for someone, and if she can’t \\nget her torture, she’ll throw herself out of a window. I’ve \\nheard something of a Mr. Razumihin—he’s said to be a sen-\\nsible fellow; his surname suggests it, indeed. He’s probably \\na divinity student. Well, he’d better look after your sister! \\nI believe I understand her, and I am proud of it. But at the \\nbeginning of an acquaintance, as you know, one is apt to \\nbe more heedless and stupid. One doesn’t see clearly. Hang \\nit all, why is she so handsome? It’s not my fault. In fact, it \\nbegan on my side with a most irresistible physical desire. \\nAvdotya Romanovna is awfully chaste, incredibly and phe-\\nnomenally so. Take note, I tell you this about your sister as \\na fact. She is almost morbidly chaste, in spite of her broad \\nintelligence, and it will stand in her way. There happened \\nto be a girl in the house then, Parasha, a black-eyed wench, \\nwhom I had never seen before—she had just come from an-\\nother village—very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she burst \\ninto tears, wailed so that she could be heard all over the \\nplace and caused scandal. One day after dinner Avdotya \\nRomanovna followed me into an avenue in the garden and \\nwith flashing eyes insisted on my leaving poor Parasha \\nalone. It was almost our first conversation by ourselves. I, \\nof course, was only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to \\nappear disconcerted, embarrassed, in fact played my part \\nnot badly. Then came interviews, mysterious conversations, \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf649\\uf649\\nexhortations, entreaties, supplications, even tears—would \\nyou believe it, even tears? Think what the passion for pro-\\npaganda will bring some girls to! I, of course, threw it all on \\nmy destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and \\nfinally resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjec-\\ntion of the female heart, a weapon which never fails one. It’s \\nthe well-known resource—flattery. Nothing in the world is \\nharder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flat-\\ntery. If there’s the hundredth part of a false note in speaking \\nthe truth, it leads to a discord, and that leads to trouble. But \\nif all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it is just as agreeable, \\nand is heard not without satisfaction. It may be a coarse \\nsatisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the \\nflattery, at least half will be sure to seem true. That’s so for \\nall stages of development and classes of society. A vestal \\nvirgin might be seduced by flattery. I can never remember \\nwithout laughter how I once seduced a lady who was devot-\\ned to her husband, her children, and her principles. What \\nfun it was and how little trouble! And the lady really had \\nprinciples—of her own, anyway.',\n",
              " 'All my tactics lay in simply \\nbeing utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I \\nflattered her shamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in get-\\nting a pressure of the hand, even a glance from her, I would \\nreproach myself for having snatched it by force, and would \\ndeclare that she had resisted, so that I could never have \\ngained anything but for my being so unprincipled. I main-\\ntained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee \\nmy treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, \\nand so on. In fact, I triumphed, while my lady remained \\n\\uf649\\uf649\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nfirmly convinced that she was innocent, chaste, and faithful \\nto all her duties and obligations and had succumbed quite \\nby accident. And how angry she was with me when I ex-\\nplained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that \\nshe was just as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully \\nweak on the side of flattery, and if I had only cared to, I \\nmight have had all her property settled on me during her \\nlifetime. (I am drinking an awful lot of wine now and talk-\\ning too much.) I hope you won’t be angry if I mention now \\nthat I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya \\nRomanovna. But I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it \\nall. Avdotya Romanovna had several times—and one time \\nin particular—been greatly displeased by the expression of \\nmy eyes, would you believe it? There was sometimes a light \\nin them which frightened her and grew stronger and stron-\\nger and more unguarded till it was hateful to her. No need \\nto go into detail, but we parted. There I acted stupidly again. \\nI fell to jeering in the coarsest way at all such propaganda \\nand efforts to convert me; Parasha came on to the scene \\nagain, and not she alone; in fact there was a tremendous \\nto-do. Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how \\nyour sister’s eyes can flash sometimes! Never mind my be-\\ning drunk at this moment and having had a whole glass of \\nwine. I am speaking the truth. I assure you that this glance \\nhas haunted my dreams; the very rustle of her dress was \\nmore than I could stand at last. I really began to think that \\nI might become epileptic. I could never have believed that I \\ncould be moved to such a frenzy. It was essential, indeed, to \\nbe reconciled, but by then it was impossible. And imagine \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf649\\uf64b\\nwhat I did then! To what a pitch of stupidity a man can be \\nbrought by frenzy! Never undertake anything in a frenzy, \\nRodion Romanovitch. I reflected that Avdotya Romanovna \\nwas after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, that’s not the word \\n… but does it matter if it expresses the meaning?), that she \\nlived by her work, that she had her mother and you to keep \\n(ach, hang it, you are frowning again), and I resolved to \\noffer her all my money—thirty thousand roubles I could \\nhave realised then—if she would run away with me here, \\nto Petersburg. Of course I should have vowed eternal love, \\nrapture, and so on. Do you know, I was so wild about her \\nat that time that if she had told me to poison Marfa Petro-\\nvna or to cut her throat and to marry herself, it would have \\nbeen done at once! But it ended in the catastrophe of which \\nyou know already. You can fancy how frantic I was when I \\nheard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly \\nattorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between \\nthem—which would really have been just the same thing \\nas I was proposing. Wouldn’t it? Wouldn’t it? I notice that \\nyou’ve begun to be very attentive … you interesting young \\nman….’\\nSvidrigaïlov struck the table with his fist impatiently. \\nHe was flushed. Raskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or \\nglass and a half of champagne that he had sipped almost \\nunconsciously was affecting him— and he resolved to take \\nadvantage of the opportunity. He felt very suspicious of \\nSvidrigaïlov.\\n‘Well, after what you have said, I am fully convinced that \\nyou have come to Petersburg with designs on my sister,’ he \\n\\uf649\\uf649\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nsaid directly to Svidrigaïlov, in order to irritate him fur-\\nther.\\n‘Oh, nonsense,’ said Svidrigaïlov, seeming to rouse him-\\nself. ‘Why, I told you … besides your sister can’t endure \\nme.’\\n‘Yes, I am certain that she can’t, but that’s not the point.’\\n‘Are you so sure that she can’t?’ Svidrigaïlov screwed up \\nhis eyes and smiled mockingly. ‘You are right, she doesn’t \\nlove me, but you can never be sure of what has passed be-\\ntween husband and wife or lover and mistress. There’s \\nalways a little corner which remains a secret to the world \\nand is only known to those two. Will you answer for it that \\nAvdotya Romanovna regarded me with aversion?’\\n‘From some words you’ve dropped, I notice that you still \\nhave designs —and of course evil ones—on Dounia and \\nmean to carry them out promptly.’\\n‘What, have I dropped words like that?’ Svidrigaïlov \\nasked in naïve dismay, taking not the slightest notice of the \\nepithet bestowed on his designs.',\n",
              " '‘Why, you are dropping them even now. Why are you so \\nfrightened? What are you so afraid of now?’\\n‘Me—afraid? Afraid of you? You have rather to be afraid \\nof me, cher ami.

Do you know that \\nMadame Resslich, the woman I am lodging with now, eh? \\nI know what you’re thinking, that she’s the woman whose \\ngirl they say drowned herself in the winter. Come, are you \\nlistening? She arranged it all for me. You’re bored, she said, \\nyou want something to fill up your time. For, you know, I am \\na gloomy, depressed person. Do you think I’m light-heart-\\ned? No, I’m gloomy. I do no harm, but sit in a corner without \\nspeaking a word for three days at a time. And that Resslich \\nis a sly hussy, I tell you. I know what she has got in her mind; \\nshe thinks I shall get sick of it, abandon my wife and depart, \\nand she’ll get hold of her and make a profit out of her—in \\nour class, of course, or higher. She told me the father was a \\nbroken-down retired official, who has been sitting in a chair \\n\\uf649\\uf64a1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nfor the last three years with his legs paralysed. The mamma, \\nshe said, was a sensible woman. There is a son serving in \\nthe provinces, but he doesn’t help; there is a daughter, who \\nis married, but she doesn’t visit them. And they’ve two little \\nnephews on their hands, as though their own children were \\nnot enough, and they’ve taken from school their youngest \\ndaughter, a girl who’ll be sixteen in another month, so that \\nthen she can be married. She was for me. We went there. \\nHow funny it was! I present myself—a landowner, a widow-\\ner, of a well- known name, with connections, with a fortune. \\nWhat if I am fifty and she is not sixteen? Who thinks of \\nthat? But it’s fascinating, isn’t it? It is fascinating, ha-ha! \\nYou should have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma. \\nIt was worth paying to have seen me at that moment. She \\ncomes in, curtseys, you can fancy, still in a short frock—an \\nunopened bud! Flushing like a sunset—she had been told, \\nno doubt. I don’t know how you feel about female faces, but \\nto my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness \\nand tears of bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is \\na perfect little picture, too.',\n",
              " 'Fair hair in little curls, like a \\nlamb’s, full little rosy lips, tiny feet, a charmer! … Well, we \\nmade friends. I told them I was in a hurry owing to domes-\\ntic circumstances, and the next day, that is the day before \\nyesterday, we were betrothed. When I go now I take her on \\nmy knee at once and keep her there…. Well, she flushes \\nlike a sunset and I kiss her every minute.

You know, the Sistine Madonna’s face has some-\\nthing fantastic in it, the face of mournful religious ecstasy. \\nHaven’t you noticed it? Well, she’s something in that line. \\nThe day after we’d been betrothed, I bought her presents to \\nthe value of fifteen hundred roubles—a set of diamonds and \\nanother of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this, \\nwith all sorts of things in it, so that even my Madonna’s face \\nglowed.

Do you know, when \\nI was with Marfa Petrovna in the country, I was haunted \\nby the thought of these places where anyone who knows \\nhis way about can find a great deal. Yes, upon my soul! The \\npeasants have vodka, the educated young people, shut out \\nfrom activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams and \\nvisions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up \\nand are amassing money, and all the rest give themselves up \\nto debauchery. From the first hour the town reeked of its fa-\\nmiliar odours. I chanced to be in a frightful den—I like my \\ndens dirty—it was a dance, so called, and there was a cancan \\nsuch as I never saw in my day. Yes, there you have progress. \\nAll of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen, nicely dressed, \\ndancing with a specialist in that line, with another one vis-\\nà-vis.

Her partner \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf64a\\uf647\\nseized her and began whirling her round and performing \\nbefore her; everyone laughed and—I like your public, even \\nthe cancan public—they laughed and shouted, ‘Serves her \\nright— serves her right! Shouldn’t bring children!’ Well, \\nit’s not my business whether that consoling reflection was \\nlogical or not. I at once fixed on my plan, sat down by the \\nmother, and began by saying that I too was a stranger and \\nthat people here were ill-bred and that they couldn’t distin-\\nguish decent folks and treat them with respect, gave her to \\nunderstand that I had plenty of money, offered to take them \\nhome in my carriage. I took them home and got to know \\nthem. They were lodging in a miserable little hole and had \\nonly just arrived from the country.

It’s stimulating!’\\n‘Well, if you come to that,’ Svidrigaïlov answered, scruti-\\nnising Raskolnikov with some surprise, ‘if you come to that, \\nyou are a thorough cynic yourself. You’ve plenty to make \\nyou so, anyway. You can understand a great deal … and you \\ncan do a great deal too. But enough. I sincerely regret not \\nhaving had more talk with you, but I shan’t lose sight of \\nyou…. Only wait a bit.’\\nSvidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant. Raskolnikov \\nwalked out after him. Svidrigaïlov was not however very \\ndrunk, the wine had affected him for a moment, but it was \\npassing off every minute. He was preoccupied with some-\\nthing of importance and was frowning. He was apparently \\nexcited and uneasy in anticipation of something. His man-\\nner to Raskolnikov had changed during the last few minutes, \\nand he was ruder and more sneering every moment. Ras-\\nkolnikov noticed all this, and he too was uneasy. He became \\nvery suspicious of Svidrigaïlov and resolved to follow him.\\nThey came out on to the pavement.\\n‘You go to the right, and I to the left, or if you like, the \\nother way. Only adieu, mon plaisir may we meet again.’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf64a\\uf649\\nAnd he walked to the right towards the Hay Market.\\n\\uf649\\uf64a\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter V\\nR\\naskolnikov walked after him.\\n‘What’s this?’ cried Svidrigaïlov turning round, ‘I \\nthought I said …’\\n‘It means that I am not going to lose sight of you now.’\\n‘What?’\\nBoth stood still and gazed at one another, as though \\nmeasuring their strength.\\n‘From all your half tipsy stories,’ Raskolnikov observed \\nharshly, ‘I am positive that you have not given up your de-\\nsigns on my sister, but are pursuing them more actively than \\never. I have learnt that my sister received a letter this morn-\\ning. You have hardly been able to sit still all this time…. \\nYou may have unearthed a wife on the way, but that means \\nnothing.',\n",
              " 'I should like to make certain myself.’\\nRaskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he \\nwanted and of what he wished to make certain.\\n‘Upon my word! I’ll call the police!’\\n‘Call away!’\\nAgain they stood for a minute facing each other. At last \\nSvidrigaïlov’s face changed. Having satisfied himself that \\nRaskolnikov was not frightened at his threat, he assumed a \\nmirthful and friendly air.\\n‘What a fellow! I purposely refrained from referring to \\nyour affair, though I am devoured by curiosity. It’s a fantas-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf64a\\uf64b\\ntic affair. I’ve put it off till another time, but you’re enough \\nto rouse the dead…. Well, let us go, only I warn you be-\\nforehand I am only going home for a moment, to get some \\nmoney; then I shall lock up the flat, take a cab and go to \\nspend the evening at the Islands. Now, now are you going \\nto follow me?’\\n‘I’m coming to your lodgings, not to see you but Sofya \\nSemyonovna, to say I’m sorry not to have been at the fu-\\nneral.’\\n‘That’s as you like, but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. \\nShe has taken the three children to an old lady of high rank, \\nthe patroness of some orphan asylums, whom I used to \\nknow years ago. I charmed the old lady by depositing a sum \\nof money with her to provide for the three children of Kat-\\nerina Ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well. I \\ntold her too the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail, \\nsuppressing nothing. It produced an indescribable effect \\non her. That’s why Sofya Semyonovna has been invited to \\ncall to-day at the X. Hotel where the lady is staying for the \\ntime.’\\n‘No matter, I’ll come all the same.’\\n‘As you like, it’s nothing to me, but I won’t come with \\nyou; here we are at home. By the way, I am convinced that \\nyou regard me with suspicion just because I have shown \\nsuch delicacy and have not so far troubled you with ques-\\ntions … you understand? It struck you as extraordinary; I \\ndon’t mind betting it’s that. Well, it teaches one to show del-\\nicacy!’\\n‘And to listen at doors!’\\n\\uf649\\uf64a\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘Ah, that’s it, is it?’ laughed Svidrigaïlov. ‘Yes, I should \\nhave been surprised if you had let that pass after all that \\nhas happened. Ha-ha! Though I did understand something \\nof the pranks you had been up to and were telling Sofya \\nSemyonovna about, what was the meaning of it? Perhaps \\nI am quite behind the times and can’t understand. For \\ngoodness’ sake, explain it, my dear boy. Expound the lat-\\nest theories!’\\n‘You couldn’t have heard anything. You’re making it all \\nup!’\\n‘But I’m not talking about that (though I did hear some-\\nthing). No, I’m talking of the way you keep sighing and \\ngroaning now. The Schiller in you is in revolt every moment, \\nand now you tell me not to listen at doors. If that’s how you \\nfeel, go and inform the police that you had this mischance: \\nyou made a little mistake in your theory. But if you are con-\\nvinced that one mustn’t listen at doors, but one may murder \\nold women at one’s pleasure, you’d better be off to America \\nand make haste. Run, young man! There may still be time. \\nI’m speaking sincerely. Haven’t you the money? I’ll give you \\nthe fare.’\\n‘I’m not thinking of that at all,’ Raskolnikov interrupted \\nwith disgust.\\n‘I understand (but don’t put yourself out, don’t discuss \\nit if you don’t want to). I understand the questions you are \\nworrying over— moral ones, aren’t they? Duties of citizen \\nand man? Lay them all aside. They are nothing to you now, \\nha-ha! You’ll say you are still a man and a citizen. If so you \\nought not to have got into this coil. It’s no use taking up a \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf64b0\\njob you are not fit for.',\n",
              " 'Well, you’d better shoot yourself, or \\ndon’t you want to?’\\n‘You seem trying to enrage me, to make me leave you.’\\n‘What a queer fellow! But here we are. Welcome to the \\nstaircase. You see, that’s the way to Sofya Semyonovna. Look, \\nthere is no one at home. Don’t you believe me? Ask Kaper-\\nnaumov. She leaves the key with him. Here is Madame de \\nKapernaumov herself. Hey, what? She is rather deaf. Has \\nshe gone out? Where? Did you hear? She is not in and won’t \\nbe till late in the evening probably. Well, come to my room; \\nyou wanted to come and see me, didn’t you? Here we are. \\nMadame Resslich’s not at home. She is a woman who is al-\\nways busy, an excellent woman I assure you…. She might \\nhave been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible. \\nNow, see! I take this five-per-cent bond out of the bureau—\\nsee what a lot I’ve got of them still—this one will be turned \\ninto cash to-day. I mustn’t waste any more time. The bureau \\nis locked, the flat is locked, and here we are again on the \\nstairs. Shall we take a cab? I’m going to the Islands. Would \\nyou like a lift? I’ll take this carriage. Ah, you refuse? You are \\ntired of it! Come for a drive! I believe it will come on to rain. \\nNever mind, we’ll put down the hood….’\\nSvidrigaïlov was already in the carriage. Raskolnikov \\ndecided that his suspicions were at least for that moment \\nunjust. Without answering a word he turned and walked \\nback towards the Hay Market. If he had only turned round \\non his way he might have seen Svidrigaïlov get out not a \\nhundred paces off, dismiss the cab and walk along the pave-\\nment. But he had turned the corner and could see nothing. \\n\\uf649\\uf64b1\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nIntense disgust drew him away from Svidrigaïlov.\\n‘To think that I could for one instant have looked for help \\nfrom that coarse brute, that depraved sensualist and black-\\nguard!’ he cried.\\nRaskolnikov’s judgment was uttered too lightly and \\nhastily: there was something about Svidrigaïlov which \\ngave him a certain original, even a mysterious character. \\nAs concerned his sister, Raskolnikov was convinced that \\nSvidrigaïlov would not leave her in peace. But it was too \\ntiresome and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking \\nabout this.\\nWhen he was alone, he had not gone twenty paces before \\nhe sank, as usual, into deep thought. On the bridge he stood \\nby the railing and began gazing at the water. And his sister \\nwas standing close by him.\\nHe met her at the entrance to the bridge, but passed by \\nwithout seeing her. Dounia had never met him like this in \\nthe street before and was struck with dismay. She stood still \\nand did not know whether to call to him or not. Suddenly \\nshe saw Svidrigaïlov coming quickly from the direction of \\nthe Hay Market.\\nHe seemed to be approaching cautiously.',\n",
              " 'He did not go \\non to the bridge, but stood aside on the pavement, doing \\nall he could to avoid Raskolnikov’s seeing him. He had ob-\\nserved Dounia for some time and had been making signs to \\nher. She fancied he was signalling to beg her not to speak to \\nher brother, but to come to him.\\nThat was what Dounia did. She stole by her brother and \\nwent up to Svidrigaïlov.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf64b\\uf645\\n‘Let us make haste away,’ Svidrigaïlov whispered to her, \\n‘I don’t want Rodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting. \\nI must tell you I’ve been sitting with him in the restaurant \\nclose by, where he looked me up and I had great difficulty \\nin getting rid of him. He has somehow heard of my letter to \\nyou and suspects something. It wasn’t you who told him, of \\ncourse, but if not you, who then?’\\n‘Well, we’ve turned the corner now,’ Dounia interrupted, \\n‘and my brother won’t see us. I have to tell you that I am go-\\ning no further with you. Speak to me here. You can tell it all \\nin the street.’\\n‘In the first place, I can’t say it in the street; secondly, you \\nmust hear Sofya Semyonovna too; and, thirdly, I will show \\nyou some papers…. Oh well, if you won’t agree to come with \\nme, I shall refuse to give any explanation and go away at \\nonce. But I beg you not to forget that a very curious secret of \\nyour beloved brother’s is entirely in my keeping.’\\nDounia stood still, hesitating, and looked at Svidrigaïlov \\nwith searching eyes.\\n‘What are you afraid of?’ he observed quietly. ‘The town \\nis not the country. And even in the country you did me \\nmore harm than I did you.’\\n‘Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna?’\\n‘No, I have not said a word to her and am not quite cer-\\ntain whether she is at home now. But most likely she is. She \\nhas buried her stepmother to-day: she is not likely to go vis-\\niting on such a day. For the time I don’t want to speak to \\nanyone about it and I half regret having spoken to you. The \\nslightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like \\n\\uf649\\uf64b\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthis. I live there in that house, we are coming to it. That’s the \\nporter of our house—he knows me very well; you see, he’s \\nbowing; he sees I’m coming with a lady and no doubt he has \\nnoticed your face already and you will be glad of that if you \\nare afraid of me and suspicious. Excuse my putting things \\nso coarsely. I haven’t a flat to myself; Sofya Semyonovna’s \\nroom is next to mine—she lodges in the next flat. The whole \\nfloor is let out in lodgings. Why are you frightened like a \\nchild? Am I really so terrible?’\\nSvidrigaïlov’s lips were twisted in a condescending \\nsmile; but he was in no smiling mood. His heart was throb-\\nbing and he could scarcely breathe. He spoke rather loud to \\ncover his growing excitement. But Dounia did not notice \\nthis peculiar excitement, she was so irritated by his remark \\nthat she was frightened of him like a child and that he was \\nso terrible to her.\\n‘Though I know that you are not a man … of honour, I \\nam not in the least afraid of you. Lead the way,’ she said \\nwith apparent composure, but her face was very pale.\\nSvidrigaïlov stopped at Sonia’s room.\\n‘Allow me to inquire whether she is at home…. She is not. \\nHow unfortunate! But I know she may come quite soon.',\n",
              " 'If \\nshe’s gone out, it can only be to see a lady about the orphans. \\nTheir mother is dead…. I’ve been meddling and making ar-\\nrangements for them. If Sofya Semyonovna does not come \\nback in ten minutes, I will send her to you, to-day if you like. \\nThis is my flat. These are my two rooms. Madame Resslich, \\nmy landlady, has the next room. Now, look this way. I will \\nshow you my chief piece of evidence: this door from my \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf64b\\uf647\\nbedroom leads into two perfectly empty rooms, which are \\nto let. Here they are … You must look into them with some \\nattention.’\\nSvidrigaïlov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms. \\nDounia was looking about her mistrustfully, but saw noth-\\ning special in the furniture or position of the rooms. Yet \\nthere was something to observe, for instance, that Svidriga-\\nïlov’s flat was exactly between two sets of almost uninhabited \\napartments. His rooms were not entered directly from the \\npassage, but through the landlady’s two almost empty \\nrooms. Unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, Svid-\\nrigaïlov showed Dounia the two empty rooms that were to \\nlet. Dounia stopped in the doorway, not knowing what she \\nwas called to look upon, but Svidrigaïlov hastened to ex-\\nplain.\\n‘Look here, at this second large room. Notice that door, \\nit’s locked. By the door stands a chair, the only one in the \\ntwo rooms. I brought it from my rooms so as to listen \\nmore conveniently. Just the other side of the door is Sofya \\nSemyonovna’s table; she sat there talking to Rodion Roma-\\nnovitch. And I sat here listening on two successive evenings, \\nfor two hours each time—and of course I was able to learn \\nsomething, what do you think?’\\n‘You listened?’\\n‘Yes, I did. Now come back to my room; we can’t sit down \\nhere.’\\nHe brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his sitting-\\nroom and offered her a chair. He sat down at the opposite \\nside of the table, at least seven feet from her, but probably \\n\\uf649\\uf64b\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthere was the same glow in his eyes which had once fright-\\nened Dounia so much. She shuddered and once more looked \\nabout her distrustfully. It was an involuntary gesture; she \\nevidently did not wish to betray her uneasiness. But the \\nsecluded position of Svidrigaïlov’s lodging had suddenly \\nstruck her. She wanted to ask whether his landlady at least \\nwere at home, but pride kept her from asking. Moreover, she \\nhad another trouble in her heart incomparably greater than \\nfear for herself. She was in great distress.\\n‘Here is your letter,’ she said, laying it on the table. ‘Can \\nit be true what you write? You hint at a crime committed, \\nyou say, by my brother. You hint at it too clearly; you daren’t \\ndeny it now. I must tell you that I’d heard of this stupid \\nstory before you wrote and don’t believe a word of it. It’s a \\ndisgusting and ridiculous suspicion. I know the story and \\nwhy and how it was invented. You can have no proofs. You \\npromised to prove it.',\n",
              " 'Speak! But let me warn you that I don’t \\nbelieve you! I don’t believe you!’\\nDounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an instant \\nthe colour rushed to her face.\\n‘If you didn’t believe it, how could you risk coming alone \\nto my rooms? Why have you come? Simply from curiosity?’\\n‘Don’t torment me. Speak, speak!’\\n‘There’s no denying that you are a brave girl. Upon my \\nword, I thought you would have asked Mr. Razumihin to \\nescort you here. But he was not with you nor anywhere \\nnear. I was on the look-out. It’s spirited of you, it proves you \\nwanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch. But everything is di-\\nvine in you…. About your brother, what am I to say to you? \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf64b\\uf649\\nYou’ve just seen him yourself. What did you think of him?’\\n‘Surely that’s not the only thing you are building on?’\\n‘No, not on that, but on his own words. He came here \\non two successive evenings to see Sofya Semyonovna. I’ve \\nshown you where they sat. He made a full confession to \\nher. He is a murderer. He killed an old woman, a pawnbro-\\nker, with whom he had pawned things himself. He killed \\nher sister too, a pedlar woman called Lizaveta, who hap-\\npened to come in while he was murdering her sister. He \\nkilled them with an axe he brought with him. He murdered \\nthem to rob them and he did rob them. He took money and \\nvarious things…. He told all this, word for word, to Sofya \\nSemyonovna, the only person who knows his secret. But \\nshe has had no share by word or deed in the murder; she \\nwas as horrified at it as you are now. Don’t be anxious, she \\nwon’t betray him.’\\n‘It cannot be,’ muttered Dounia, with white lips. She \\ngasped for breath. ‘It cannot be. There was not the slightest \\ncause, no sort of ground…. It’s a lie, a lie!’\\n‘He robbed her, that was the cause, he took money and \\nthings. It’s true that by his own admission he made no use \\nof the money or things, but hid them under a stone, where \\nthey are now. But that was because he dared not make use \\nof them.’\\n‘But how could he steal, rob? How could he dream of it?’ \\ncried Dounia, and she jumped up from the chair. ‘Why, you \\nknow him, and you’ve seen him, can he be a thief?’\\nShe seemed to be imploring Svidrigaïlov; she had entire-\\nly forgotten her fear.\\n\\uf649\\uf64b\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\n‘There are thousands and millions of combinations and \\npossibilities, Avdotya Romanovna. A thief steals and knows \\nhe is a scoundrel, but I’ve heard of a gentleman who broke \\nopen the mail. Who knows, very likely he thought he was \\ndoing a gentlemanly thing! Of course I should not have \\nbelieved it myself if I’d been told of it as you have, but I be-\\nlieve my own ears. He explained all the causes of it to Sofya \\nSemyonovna too, but she did not believe her ears at first, yet \\nshe believed her own eyes at last.’\\n‘What … were the causes?’\\n‘It’s a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. Here’s … how \\nshall I tell you?—A theory of a sort, the same one by which \\nI for instance consider that a single misdeed is permissible \\nif the principal aim is right, a solitary wrongdoing and hun-\\ndreds of good deeds! It’s galling too, of course, for a young \\nman of gifts and overweening pride to know that if he had, \\nfor instance, a paltry three thousand, his whole career, his \\nwhole future would be differently shaped and yet not to \\nhave that three thousand. Add to that, nervous irritability \\nfrom hunger, from lodging in a hole, from rags, from a vivid \\nsense of the charm of his social position and his sister’s and \\nmother’s position too.',\n",
              " 'Above all, vanity, pride and vanity, \\nthough goodness knows he may have good qualities too…. \\nI am not blaming him, please don’t think it; besides, it’s not \\nmy business. A special little theory came in too—a theory \\nof a sort—dividing mankind, you see, into material and su-\\nperior persons, that is persons to whom the law does not \\napply owing to their superiority, who make laws for the rest \\nof mankind, the material, that is. It’s all right as a theory, \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf64b\\uf64b\\nune théorie comme une autre. Napoleon attracted him tre-\\nmendously, that is, what affected him was that a great many \\nmen of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing, but have \\noverstepped the law without thinking about it. He seems \\nto have fancied that he was a genius too—that is, he was \\nconvinced of it for a time. He has suffered a great deal and \\nis still suffering from the idea that he could make a theory, \\nbut was incapable of boldly overstepping the law, and so he \\nis not a man of genius.

Is \\nhe like that?’\\n‘Ah, Avdotya Romanovna, everything is in a muddle now; \\nnot that it was ever in very good order. Russians in general \\nare broad in their ideas, Avdotya Romanovna, broad like \\ntheir land and exceedingly disposed to the fantastic, the \\nchaotic. But it’s a misfortune to be broad without a special \\ngenius. Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together \\non this subject, sitting in the evenings on the terrace after \\nsupper? Why, you used to reproach me with breadth! Who \\nknows, perhaps we were talking at the very time when he \\nwas lying here thinking over his plan. There are no sacred \\ntraditions amongst us, especially in the educated class, Av-\\ndotya Romanovna. At the best someone will make them up \\nsomehow for himself out of books or from some old chron-\\nicle.

Open it!’ she called, shaking the door. ‘Open it! \\nIs there no one there?’\\nSvidrigaïlov got up and came to himself. His still trem-\\nbling lips slowly broke into an angry mocking smile.\\n‘There is no one at home,’ he said quietly and emphatical-\\nly. ‘The landlady has gone out, and it’s waste of time to shout \\nlike that. You are only exciting yourself uselessly.’\\n‘Where is the key? Open the door at once, at once, base \\nman!’\\n‘I have lost the key and cannot find it.’\\n‘This is an outrage,’ cried Dounia, turning pale as death. \\nShe rushed to the furthest corner, where she made haste to \\nbarricade herself with a little table.\\nShe did not scream, but she fixed her eyes on her tormen-\\ntor and watched every movement he made.\\nSvidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end of the \\nroom facing her. He was positively composed, at least in \\nappearance, but his face was pale as before. The mocking \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf64c\\uf645\\nsmile did not leave his face.\\n‘You spoke of outrage just now, Avdotya Romanovna. \\nIn that case you may be sure I’ve taken measures. Sofya \\nSemyonovna is not at home. The Kapernaumovs are far \\naway—there are five locked rooms between. I am at least \\ntwice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear, besides. \\nFor you could not complain afterwards. You surely would \\nnot be willing actually to betray your brother? Besides, no \\none would believe you. How should a girl have come alone \\nto visit a solitary man in his lodgings? So that even if you \\ndo sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing. It is very \\ndifficult to prove an assault, Avdotya Romanovna.’\\n‘Scoundrel!’ whispered Dounia indignantly.\\n‘As you like, but observe I was only speaking by way of \\na general proposition. It’s my personal conviction that you \\nare perfectly right —violence is hateful. I only spoke to show \\nyou that you need have no remorse even if … you were will-\\ning to save your brother of your own accord, as I suggest to \\nyou. You would be simply submitting to circumstances, to \\nviolence, in fact, if we must use that word. Think about it. \\nYour brother’s and your mother’s fate are in your hands. I \\nwill be your slave … all my life … I will wait here.’\\nSvidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from \\nDounia. She had not the slightest doubt now of his unbend-\\ning determination. Besides, she knew him. Suddenly she \\npulled out of her pocket a revolver, cocked it and laid it in \\nher hand on the table. Svidrigaïlov jumped up.',\n",
              " '‘Aha! So that’s it, is it?’ he cried, surprised but smil-\\ning maliciously. ‘Well, that completely alters the aspect of \\n\\uf649\\uf64c\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\naffairs. You’ve made things wonderfully easier for me, Av-\\ndotya Romanovna. But where did you get the revolver? Was \\nit Mr. Razumihin? Why, it’s my revolver, an old friend! And \\nhow I’ve hunted for it! The shooting lessons I’ve given you \\nin the country have not been thrown away.’\\n‘It’s not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, \\nwhom you killed, wretch! There was nothing of yours in her \\nhouse. I took it when I began to suspect what you were ca-\\npable of. If you dare to advance one step, I swear I’ll kill you.’ \\nShe was frantic.\\n‘But your brother? I ask from curiosity,’ said Svidrigaïlov, \\nstill standing where he was.\\n‘Inform, if you want to! Don’t stir! Don’t come nearer! I’ll \\nshoot! You poisoned your wife, I know; you are a murderer \\nyourself!’ She held the revolver ready.\\n‘Are you so positive I poisoned Marfa Petrovna?’\\n‘You did! You hinted it yourself; you talked to me of \\npoison…. I know you went to get it … you had it in readi-\\nness…. It was your doing…. It must have been your doing…. \\nScoundrel!’\\n‘Even if that were true, it would have been for your sake \\n… you would have been the cause.’\\n‘You are lying! I hated you always, always….’\\n‘Oho, Avdotya Romanovna! You seem to have forgotten \\nhow you softened to me in the heat of propaganda. I saw it \\nin your eyes. Do you remember that moonlight night, when \\nthe nightingale was singing?’\\n‘That’s a lie,’ there was a flash of fury in Dounia’s eyes, \\n‘that’s a lie and a libel!’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf64c\\uf647\\n‘A lie? Well, if you like, it’s a lie. I made it up. Women \\nought not to be reminded of such things,’ he smiled. ‘I know \\nyou will shoot, you pretty wild creature. Well, shoot away!’\\nDounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at \\nhim, measuring the distance and awaiting the first move-\\nment on his part. Her lower lip was white and quivering and \\nher big black eyes flashed like fire. He had never seen her so \\nhandsome. The fire glowing in her eyes at the moment she \\nraised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a \\npang of anguish in his heart. He took a step forward and a \\nshot rang out. The bullet grazed his hair and flew into the \\nwall behind. He stood still and laughed softly.\\n‘The wasp has stung me. She aimed straight at my head. \\nWhat’s this? Blood?’ he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe \\nthe blood, which flowed in a thin stream down his right \\ntemple. The bullet seemed to have just grazed the skin.\\nDounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigaïlov \\nnot so much in terror as in a sort of wild amazement. She \\nseemed not to understand what she was doing and what \\nwas going on.\\n‘Well, you missed! Fire again, I’ll wait,’ said Svidrigaïlov \\nsoftly, still smiling, but gloomily. ‘If you go on like that, I \\nshall have time to seize you before you cock again.’\\nDounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again \\nraised it.',\n",
              " '‘Let me be,’ she cried in despair. ‘I swear I’ll shoot again. \\nI … I’ll kill you.’\\n‘Well … at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you \\ndon’t … then.’ His eyes flashed and he took two steps for-\\n\\uf649\\uf64c\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nward. Dounia shot again: it missed fire.\\n‘You haven’t loaded it properly. Never mind, you have an-\\nother charge there. Get it ready, I’ll wait.’\\nHe stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing \\nat her with wild determination, with feverishly passionate, \\nstubborn, set eyes. Dounia saw that he would sooner die \\nthan let her go. ‘And … now, of course she would kill him, at \\ntwo paces!’ Suddenly she flung away the revolver.\\n‘She’s dropped it!’ said Svidrigaïlov with surprise, and he \\ndrew a deep breath. A weight seemed to have rolled from \\nhis heart—perhaps not only the fear of death; indeed he \\nmay scarcely have felt it at that moment. It was the deliver-\\nance from another feeling, darker and more bitter, which he \\ncould not himself have defined.\\nHe went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her \\nwaist. She did not resist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at \\nhim with suppliant eyes. He tried to say something, but his \\nlips moved without being able to utter a sound.\\n‘Let me go,’ Dounia implored. Svidrigaïlov shuddered. \\nHer voice now was quite different.\\n‘Then you don’t love me?’ he asked softly. Dounia shook \\nher head.\\n‘And … and you can’t? Never?’ he whispered in despair.\\n‘Never!’\\nThere followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in \\nthe heart of Svidrigaïlov. He looked at her with an indescrib-\\nable gaze. Suddenly he withdrew his arm, turned quickly to \\nthe window and stood facing it. Another moment passed.\\n‘Here’s the key.’\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf64c\\uf649\\nHe took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on \\nthe table behind him, without turning or looking at Dou-\\nnia.\\n‘Take it! Make haste!’\\nHe looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia went \\nup to the table to take the key.\\n‘Make haste! Make haste!’ repeated Svidrigaïlov, still \\nwithout turning or moving. But there seemed a terrible sig-\\nnificance in the tone of that ‘make haste.’\\nDounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the \\ndoor, unlocked it quickly and rushed out of the room. A \\nminute later, beside herself, she ran out on to the canal bank \\nin the direction of X. Bridge.\\nSvidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the \\nwindow.',\n",
              " 'At last he slowly turned, looked about him and \\npassed his hand over his forehead. A strange smile con-\\ntorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of despair. \\nThe blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand. \\nHe looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his \\ntemple. The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near \\nthe door and suddenly caught his eye. He picked it up and \\nexamined it. It was a little pocket three-barrel revolver of \\nold-fashioned construction. There were still two charges \\nand one capsule left in it. It could be fired again. He thought \\na little, put the revolver in his pocket, took his hat and went \\nout.\\n\\uf649\\uf64c\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter VI\\nH\\ne spent that evening till ten o’clock going from one low \\nhaunt to another. Katia too turned up and sang an-\\nother gutter song, how a certain ‘villain and tyrant began \\nkissing Katia.’\\nSvidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and \\nsome singers and the waiters and two little clerks. He was \\nparticularly drawn to these clerks by the fact that they both \\nhad crooked noses, one bent to the left and the other to the \\nright. They took him finally to a pleasure garden, where he \\npaid for their entrance. There was one lanky three- year-old \\npine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a ‘Vaux-\\nhall,’ which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was \\nserved, and there were a few green tables and chairs stand-\\ning round it. A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken \\nbut exceedingly depressed German clown from Munich \\nwith a red nose entertained the public. The clerks quarrelled \\nwith some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent. Svid-\\nrigaïlov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to \\nthem for a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that \\nthere was no possibility of understanding them. The only \\nfact that seemed certain was that one of them had stolen \\nsomething and had even succeeded in selling it on the spot \\nto a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his companion. \\nFinally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon be-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf649\\uf64c\\uf64b\\nlonging to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began \\nto seem troublesome. Svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon, got \\nup, and walked out of the garden. It was about six o’clock. \\nHe had not drunk a drop of wine all this time and had or-\\ndered tea more for the sake of appearances than anything.\\nIt was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-\\nclouds came over the sky about ten o’clock. There was a \\nclap of thunder, and the rain came down like a waterfall. \\nThe water fell not in drops, but beat on the earth in streams. \\nThere were flashes of lightning every minute and each flash \\nlasted while one could count five.\\nDrenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, \\nopened the bureau, took out all his money and tore up two \\nor three papers. Then, putting the money in his pocket, he \\nwas about to change his clothes, but, looking out of the win-\\ndow and listening to the thunder and the rain, he gave up \\nthe idea, took up his hat and went out of the room with-\\nout locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She was at \\nhome.\\nShe was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were \\nwith her. She was giving them tea. She received Svidrigaïlov \\nin respectful silence, looking wonderingly at his soaking \\nclothes. The children all ran away at once in indescribable \\nterror.',\n",
              " 'Svidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit \\nbeside him. She timidly prepared to listen.\\n‘I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna,’ said \\nSvidrigaïlov, ‘and as I am probably seeing you for the last \\ntime, I have come to make some arrangements. Well, did \\n\\uf649\\uf64c\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nyou see the lady to-day? I know what she said to you, you \\nneed not tell me.’ (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) \\n‘Those people have their own way of doing things. As to \\nyour sisters and your brother, they are really provided for \\nand the money assigned to them I’ve put into safe keeping \\nand have received acknowledgments. You had better take \\ncharge of the receipts, in case anything happens. Here, take \\nthem! Well now, that’s settled. Here are three 5-per-cent \\nbonds to the value of three thousand roubles. Take those \\nfor yourself, entirely for yourself, and let that be strictly be-\\ntween ourselves, so that no one knows of it, whatever you \\nhear. You will need the money, for to go on living in the \\nold way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no \\nneed for it now.’\\n‘I am so much indebted to you, and so are the children \\nand my stepmother,’ said Sonia hurriedly, ‘and if I’ve said so \\nlittle … please don’t consider …’\\n‘That’s enough! that’s enough!’\\n‘But as for the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I am very grate-\\nful to you, but I don’t need it now. I can always earn my own \\nliving. Don’t think me ungrateful. If you are so charitable, \\nthat money….’\\n‘It’s for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don’t \\nwaste words over it. I haven’t time for it. You will want it. Ro-\\ndion Romanovitch has two alternatives: a bullet in the brain \\nor Siberia.’ (Sonia looked wildly at him, and started.) ‘Don’t \\nbe uneasy, I know all about it from himself and I am not a \\ngossip; I won’t tell anyone. It was good advice when you told \\nhim to give himself up and confess. It would be much bet-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a00\\nter for him. Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go and \\nyou will follow him. That’s so, isn’t it? And if so, you’ll need \\nmoney. You’ll need it for him, do you understand? Giving \\nit to you is the same as my giving it to him. Besides, you \\npromised Amalia Ivanovna to pay what’s owing. I heard \\nyou. How can you undertake such obligations so heedless-\\nly, Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovna’s debt and \\nnot yours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the \\nGerman woman. You can’t get through the world like that. \\nIf you are ever questioned about me—to-morrow or the day \\nafter you will be asked—don’t say anything about my com-\\ning to see you now and don’t show the money to anyone or \\nsay a word about it. Well, now good- bye.’ (He got up.) ‘My \\ngreetings to Rodion Romanovitch. By the way, you’d better \\nput the money for the present in Mr. Razumihin’s keeping. \\nYou know Mr. Razumihin? Of course you do.',\n",
              " 'He’s not a bad \\nfellow. Take it to him to-morrow or … when the time comes. \\nAnd till then, hide it carefully.’\\nSonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dis-\\nmay at Svidrigaïlov. She longed to speak, to ask a question, \\nbut for the first moments she did not dare and did not know \\nhow to begin.\\n‘How can you … how can you be going now, in such \\nrain?’\\n‘Why, be starting for America, and be stopped by rain! \\nHa, ha! Good- bye, Sofya Semyonovna, my dear! Live and \\nlive long, you will be of use to others. By the way … tell Mr. \\nRazumihin I send my greetings to him. Tell him Arkady \\nIvanovitch Svidrigaïlov sends his greetings. Be sure to.’\\n\\uf64a01\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nHe went out, leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxi-\\nety and vague apprehension.\\nIt appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at \\ntwenty past eleven, he made another very eccentric and \\nunexpected visit. The rain still persisted. Drenched to \\nthe skin, he walked into the little flat where the parents \\nof his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky Is-\\nland. He knocked some time before he was admitted, and \\nhis visit at first caused great perturbation; but Svidrigaïlov \\ncould be very fascinating when he liked, so that the first, \\nand indeed very intelligent surmise of the sensible parents \\nthat Svidrigaïlov had probably had so much to drink that \\nhe did not know what he was doing vanished immediate-\\nly. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see Svidrigaïlov \\nby the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the \\nconversation with various irrelevant questions. She never \\nasked a direct question, but began by smiling and rubbing \\nher hands and then, if she were obliged to ascertain some-\\nthing—for instance, when Svidrigaïlov would like to have \\nthe wedding—she would begin by interested and almost ea-\\nger questions about Paris and the court life there, and only \\nby degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. \\nOn other occasions this had of course been very impressive, \\nbut this time Arkady Ivanovitch seemed particularly impa-\\ntient, and insisted on seeing his betrothed at once, though \\nhe had been informed, to begin with, that she had already \\ngone to bed. The girl of course appeared.\\nSvidrigaïlov informed her at once that he was obliged \\nby very important affairs to leave Petersburg for a time, \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a0\\uf645\\nand therefore brought her fifteen thousand roubles and \\nbegged her accept them as a present from him, as he had \\nlong been intending to make her this trifling present be-\\nfore their wedding. The logical connection of the present \\nwith his immediate departure and the absolute necessity of \\nvisiting them for that purpose in pouring rain at midnight \\nwas not made clear. But it all went off very well; even the \\ninevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret, the inevitable \\nquestions were extraordinarily few and restrained. On the \\nother hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and \\nwas reinforced by tears from the most sensible of mothers. \\nSvidrigaïlov got up, laughed, kissed his betrothed, patted \\nher cheek, declared he would soon come back, and noticing \\nin her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a sort of ear-\\nnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though \\nhe felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his pres-\\nent would be immediately locked up in the keeping of the \\nmost sensible of mothers. He went away, leaving them all in \\na state of extraordinary excitement, but the tender mam-\\nma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of the \\nmost important of their doubts, concluding that Svidriga-\\nïlov was a great man, a man of great affairs and connections \\nand of great wealth—there was no knowing what he had \\nin his mind. He would start off on a journey and give away \\nmoney just as the fancy took him, so that there was nothing \\nsurprising about it. Of course it was strange that he was wet \\nthrough, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more ec-\\ncentric, and all these people of high society didn’t think of \\nwhat was said of them and didn’t stand on ceremony. Pos-\\n\\uf64a0\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nsibly, indeed, he came like that on purpose to show that he \\nwas not afraid of anyone. Above all, not a word should be \\nsaid about it, for God knows what might come of it, and the \\nmoney must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that \\nFedosya, the cook, had not left the kitchen. And above all \\nnot a word must be said to that old cat, Madame Resslich, \\nand so on and so on. They sat up whispering till two o’clock, \\nbut the girl went to bed much earlier, amazed and rather \\nsorrowful.\\nSvidrigaïlov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed \\nthe bridge on the way back to the mainland. The rain had \\nceased and there was a roaring wind. He began shivering, \\nand for one moment he gazed at the black waters of the Lit-\\ntle Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry. But he \\nsoon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and \\nwent towards Y. Prospect. He walked along that endless \\nstreet for a long time, almost half an hour, more than once \\nstumbling in the dark on the wooden pavement, but contin-\\nually looking for something on the right side of the street. \\nHe had noticed passing through this street lately that there \\nwas a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but \\nfairly large, and its name he remembered was something \\nlike Adrianople.',\n",
              " 'He was not mistaken: the hotel was so con-\\nspicuous in that God-forsaken place that he could not fail \\nto see it even in the dark. It was a long, blackened wooden \\nbuilding, and in spite of the late hour there were lights in \\nthe windows and signs of life within. He went in and asked \\na ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The \\nlatter, scanning Svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a0\\uf647\\nled him at once to a close and tiny room in the distance, at \\nthe end of the corridor, under the stairs. There was no other, \\nall were occupied. The ragged fellow looked inquiringly.\\n‘Is there tea?’ asked Svidrigaïlov.\\n‘Yes, sir.’\\n‘What else is there?’\\n‘Veal, vodka, savouries.’\\n‘Bring me tea and veal.’\\n‘And you want nothing else?’ he asked with apparent sur-\\nprise.\\n‘Nothing, nothing.’\\nThe ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.\\n‘It must be a nice place,’ thought Svidrigaïlov. ‘How was \\nit I didn’t know it? I expect I look as if I came from a café \\nchantant and have had some adventure on the way. It would \\nbe interesting to know who stay here?’\\nHe lighted the candle and looked at the room more care-\\nfully. It was a room so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could \\nonly just stand up in it; it had one window; the bed, which \\nwas very dirty, and the plain- stained chair and table almost \\nfilled it up. The walls looked as though they were made of \\nplanks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty that \\nthe pattern was indistinguishable, though the general co-\\nlour—yellow—could still be made out. One of the walls was \\ncut short by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not \\nan attic but just under the stairs.\\nSvidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed \\nand sank into thought. But a strange persistent murmur \\nwhich sometimes rose to a shout in the next room attracted \\n\\uf64a0\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nhis attention. The murmur had not ceased from the moment \\nhe entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding \\nand almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.\\nSvidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his hand and \\nat once he saw light through a crack in the wall; he went \\nup and peeped through. The room, which was somewhat \\nlarger than his, had two occupants. One of them, a very \\ncurly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing \\nin the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide \\napart to preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the \\nbreast. He reproached the other with being a beggar, with \\nhaving no standing whatever. He declared that he had tak-\\nen the other out of the gutter and he could turn him out \\nwhen he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it \\nall. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and \\nhad the air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but \\ncan’t. He sometimes turned sheepish and befogged eyes on \\nthe speaker, but obviously had not the slightest idea what \\nhe was talking about and scarcely heard it. A candle was \\nburning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a near-\\nly empty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses \\nwith the dregs of stale tea. After gazing attentively at this, \\nSvidrigaïlov turned away indifferently and sat down on the \\nbed.\\nThe ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not \\nresist asking him again whether he didn’t want anything \\nmore, and again receiving a negative reply, finally withdrew. \\nSvidrigaïlov made haste to drink a glass of tea to warm him-\\nself, but could not eat anything. He began to feel feverish. \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a0\\uf649\\nHe took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the blanket, \\nlay down on the bed. He was annoyed. ‘It would have been \\nbetter to be well for the occasion,’ he thought with a smile. \\nThe room was close, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was \\nroaring outside, he heard a mouse scratching in the corner \\nand the room smelt of mice and of leather.',\n",
              " 'He lay in a sort \\nof reverie: one thought followed another. He felt a longing \\nto fix his imagination on something. ‘It must be a garden \\nunder the window,’ he thought. ‘There’s a sound of trees. \\nHow I dislike the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the \\ndark! They give one a horrid feeling.’ He remembered how \\nhe had disliked it when he passed Petrovsky Park just now. \\nThis reminded him of the bridge over the Little Neva and he \\nfelt cold again as he had when standing there. ‘I never have \\nliked water,’ he thought, ‘even in a landscape,’ and he sud-\\ndenly smiled again at a strange idea: ‘Surely now all these \\nquestions of taste and comfort ought not to matter, but I’ve \\nbecome more particular, like an animal that picks out a spe-\\ncial place … for such an occasion. I ought to have gone into \\nthe Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold, ha-ha! \\nAs though I were seeking pleasant sensations! … By the way, \\nwhy haven’t I put out the candle?’ he blew it out. ‘They’ve \\ngone to bed next door,’ he thought, not seeing the light at \\nthe crack. ‘Well, now, Marfa Petrovna, now is the time for \\nyou to turn up; it’s dark, and the very time and place for you. \\nBut now you won’t come!’\\nHe suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out \\nhis design on Dounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov \\nto trust her to Razumihin’s keeping. ‘I suppose I really did \\n\\uf64a0\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nsay it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to tease myself. But what a \\nrogue that Raskolnikov is! He’s gone through a good deal. \\nHe may be a successful rogue in time when he’s got over his \\nnonsense. But now he’s too eager for life. These young men \\nare contemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow! Let \\nhim please himself, it’s nothing to do with me.’\\nHe could not get to sleep. By degrees Dounia’s image \\nrose before him, and a shudder ran over him. ‘No, I must \\ngive up all that now,’ he thought, rousing himself. ‘I must \\nthink of something else. It’s queer and funny. I never had \\na great hatred for anyone, I never particularly desired to \\navenge myself even, and that’s a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad \\nsign. I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my tem-\\nper— that’s a bad sign too. And the promises I made her \\njust now, too— Damnation! But—who knows?—perhaps \\nshe would have made a new man of me somehow….’\\nHe ground his teeth and sank into silence again. Again \\nDounia’s image rose before him, just as she was when, after \\nshooting the first time, she had lowered the revolver in ter-\\nror and gazed blankly at him, so that he might have seized \\nher twice over and she would not have lifted a hand to de-\\nfend herself if he had not reminded her. He recalled how at \\nthat instant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a \\npang at his heart …\\n‘Aïe! Damnation, these thoughts again! I must put it \\naway!’\\nHe was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when \\nsuddenly something seemed to run over his arm and leg \\nunder the bedclothes. He started. ‘Ugh! hang it! I believe \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a0\\uf64b\\nit’s a mouse,’ he thought, ‘that’s the veal I left on the table.’ \\nHe felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the blanket, get up, \\nget cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over his \\nleg again. He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle. \\nShaking with feverish chill he bent down to examine the \\nbed: there was nothing. He shook the blanket and suddenly \\na mouse jumped out on the sheet. He tried to catch it, but \\nthe mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without leaving the bed, \\nslipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and suddenly \\ndarted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow, but in \\none instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over \\nhis body and down his back under his shirt. He trembled \\nnervously and woke up.\\nThe room was dark.',\n",
              " 'He was lying on the bed and wrapped \\nup in the blanket as before. The wind was howling under \\nthe window. ‘How disgusting,’ he thought with annoyance.\\nHe got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his \\nback to the window. ‘It’s better not to sleep at all,’ he de-\\ncided. There was a cold damp draught from the window, \\nhowever; without getting up he drew the blanket over him \\nand wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking of anything \\nand did not want to think. But one image rose after anoth-\\ner, incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end \\npassed through his mind. He sank into drowsiness. Per-\\nhaps the cold, or the dampness, or the dark, or the wind \\nthat howled under the window and tossed the trees roused a \\nsort of persistent craving for the fantastic. He kept dwelling \\non images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, \\na bright, warm, almost hot day, a holiday—Trinity day. A \\n\\uf64a0\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nfine, sumptuous country cottage in the English taste over-\\ngrown with fragrant flowers, with flower beds going round \\nthe house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was surrounded \\nwith beds of roses. A light, cool staircase, carpeted with rich \\nrugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He no-\\nticed particularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, \\nheavily fragrant narcissus bending over their bright, green, \\nthick long stalks. He was reluctant to move away from \\nthem, but he went up the stairs and came into a large, high \\ndrawing-room and again everywhere—at the windows, the \\ndoors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself—were \\nflowers. The floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant \\nhay, the windows were open, a fresh, cool, light air came \\ninto the room. The birds were chirruping under the win-\\ndow, and in the middle of the room, on a table covered with \\na white satin shroud, stood a coffin. The coffin was covered \\nwith white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths \\nof flowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers \\nlay a girl in a white muslin dress, with her arms crossed \\nand pressed on her bosom, as though carved out of marble. \\nBut her loose fair hair was wet; there was a wreath of roses \\non her head. The stern and already rigid profile of her face \\nlooked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on \\nher pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and \\nsorrowful appeal. Svidrigaïlov knew that girl; there was no \\nholy image, no burning candle beside the coffin; no sound \\nof prayers: the girl had drowned herself. She was only four-\\nteen, but her heart was broken. And she had destroyed \\nherself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a10\\nthat childish soul, had smirched that angel purity with un-\\nmerited disgrace and torn from her a last scream of despair, \\nunheeded and brutally disregarded, on a dark night in the \\ncold and wet while the wind howled….\\nSvidrigaïlov came to himself, got up from the bed and \\nwent to the window. He felt for the latch and opened it. The \\nwind lashed furiously into the little room and stung his face \\nand his chest, only covered with his shirt, as though with \\nfrost. Under the window there must have been something \\nlike a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden. There, too, \\nprobably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. \\nNow drops of rain flew in at the window from the trees and \\nbushes; it was dark as in a cellar, so that he could only just \\nmake out some dark blurs of objects. Svidrigaïlov, bending \\ndown with elbows on the window-sill, gazed for five min-\\nutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed by a \\nsecond one, resounded in the darkness of the night. ‘Ah, the \\nsignal! The river is overflowing,’ he thought. ‘By morning it \\nwill be swirling down the street in the lower parts, flood-\\ning the basements and cellars. The cellar rats will swim out, \\nand men will curse in the rain and wind as they drag their \\nrubbish to their upper storeys. What time is it now?’ And he \\nhad hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on the \\nwall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.\\n‘Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I’ll go out \\nat once straight to the park. I’ll choose a great bush there \\ndrenched with rain, so that as soon as one’s shoulder touch-\\nes it, millions of drops drip on one’s head.’\\nHe moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the \\n\\uf64a11\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ncandle, put on his waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and \\nwent out, carrying the candle, into the passage to look for \\nthe ragged attendant who would be asleep somewhere in \\nthe midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay \\nhim for the room and leave the hotel.',\n",
              " '‘It’s the best minute; I \\ncouldn’t choose a better.’\\nHe walked for some time through a long narrow corridor \\nwithout finding anyone and was just going to call out, when \\nsuddenly in a dark corner between an old cupboard and the \\ndoor he caught sight of a strange object which seemed to \\nbe alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little girl, \\nnot more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her \\nclothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem \\nafraid of Svidrigaïlov, but looked at him with blank amaze-\\nment out of her big black eyes. Now and then she sobbed as \\nchildren do when they have been crying a long time, but are \\nbeginning to be comforted. The child’s face was pale and \\ntired, she was numb with cold. ‘How can she have come \\nhere? She must have hidden here and not slept all night.’ He \\nbegan questioning her. The child suddenly becoming an-\\nimated, chattered away in her baby language, something \\nabout ‘mammy’ and that ‘mammy would beat her,’ and \\nabout some cup that she had ‘bwoken.’ The child chattered \\non without stopping. He could only guess from what she \\nsaid that she was a neglected child, whose mother, prob-\\nably a drunken cook, in the service of the hotel, whipped \\nand frightened her; that the child had broken a cup of her \\nmother’s and was so frightened that she had run away the \\nevening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a1\\uf645\\noutside in the rain, at last had made her way in here, hid-\\nden behind the cupboard and spent the night there, crying \\nand trembling from the damp, the darkness and the fear \\nthat she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his \\narms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and be-\\ngan undressing her. The torn shoes which she had on her \\nstockingless feet were as wet as if they had been standing in \\na puddle all night. When he had undressed her, he put her \\non the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in the blanket \\nfrom her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he \\nsank into dreary musing again.\\n‘What folly to trouble myself,’ he decided suddenly with \\nan oppressive feeling of annoyance. ‘What idiocy!’ In vexa-\\ntion he took up the candle to go and look for the ragged \\nattendant again and make haste to go away. ‘Damn the child!’ \\nhe thought as he opened the door, but he turned again to see \\nwhether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket careful-\\nly. The child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under \\nthe blanket, and her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange \\nto say that flush seemed brighter and coarser than the rosy \\ncheeks of childhood. ‘It’s a flush of fever,’ thought Svidriga-\\nïlov. It was like the flush from drinking, as though she had \\nbeen given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips were hot \\nand glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that \\nher long black eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids \\nwere opening and a sly crafty eye peeped out with an un-\\nchildlike wink, as though the little girl were not asleep, but \\npretending. Yes, it was so. Her lips parted in a smile. The \\ncorners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying \\n\\uf64a1\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nto control them. But now she quite gave up all effort, now \\nit was a grin, a broad grin; there was something shameless, \\nprovocative in that quite unchildish face; it was depravity, \\nit was the face of a harlot, the shameless face of a French \\nharlot. Now both eyes opened wide; they turned a glowing, \\nshameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited him…. \\nThere was something infinitely hideous and shocking in \\nthat laugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of \\na child. ‘What, at five years old?’ Svidrigaïlov muttered in \\ngenuine horror. ‘What does it mean?’ And now she turned \\nto him, her little face all aglow, holding out her arms…. ‘Ac-\\ncursed child!’ Svidrigaïlov cried, raising his hand to strike \\nher, but at that moment he woke up.\\nHe was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket. The \\ncandle had not been lighted, and daylight was streaming in \\nat the windows.\\n‘I’ve had nightmare all night!’ He got up angrily, feeling \\nutterly shattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist \\noutside and he could see nothing. It was nearly five.',\n",
              " 'He had \\noverslept himself! He got up, put on his still damp jacket \\nand overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his pocket, he took it \\nout and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his pocket \\nand in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote \\na few lines in large letters. Reading them over, he sank into \\nthought with his elbows on the table. The revolver and the \\nnotebook lay beside him. Some flies woke up and settled on \\nthe untouched veal, which was still on the table. He stared \\nat them and at last with his free right hand began trying \\nto catch one. He tried till he was tired, but could not catch \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a1\\uf647\\nit. At last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting \\npursuit, he started, got up and walked resolutely out of the \\nroom. A minute later he was in the street.\\nA thick milky mist hung over the town. Svidrigaïlov \\nwalked along the slippery dirty wooden pavement to-\\nwards the Little Neva. He was picturing the waters of the \\nLittle Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island, the wet \\npaths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the \\nbush…. He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, try-\\ning to think of something else. There was not a cabman or \\na passer-by in the street. The bright yellow, wooden, little \\nhouses looked dirty and dejected with their closed shutters. \\nThe cold and damp penetrated his whole body and he be-\\ngan to shiver. From time to time he came across shop signs \\nand read each carefully. At last he reached the end of the \\nwooden pavement and came to a big stone house. A dirty, \\nshivering dog crossed his path with its tail between its \\nlegs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead drunk, \\nacross the pavement. He looked at him and went on. A high \\ntower stood up on the left. ‘Bah!’ he shouted, ‘here is a place. \\nWhy should it be Petrovsky? It will be in the presence of an \\nofficial witness anyway….’\\nHe almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the \\nstreet where there was the big house with the tower. At the \\ngreat closed gates of the house, a little man stood with his \\nshoulder leaning against them, wrapped in a grey soldier’s \\ncoat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his head. He cast a \\ndrowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov. His face wore \\nthat perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly \\n\\uf64a1\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nprinted on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They \\nboth, Svidrigaïlov and Achilles, stared at each other for a \\nfew minutes without speaking. At last it struck Achilles as \\nirregular for a man not drunk to be standing three steps \\nfrom him, staring and not saying a word.\\n‘What do you want here?’ he said, without moving or \\nchanging his position.\\n‘Nothing, brother, good morning,’ answered Svidriga-\\nïlov.\\n‘This isn’t the place.’\\n‘I am going to foreign parts, brother.’\\n‘To foreign parts?’\\n‘To America.’\\n‘America.’\\nSvidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it.

I’ve made up my mind \\nonce for all: how could I understand your plans and expect \\nyou to give an account of them? God knows what concerns \\nand plans you may have, or what ideas you are hatching; \\nso it’s not for me to keep nudging your elbow, asking you \\nwhat you are thinking about? But, my goodness! why am I \\nrunning to and fro as though I were crazy … ? I am read-\\ning your article in the magazine for the third time, Rodya. \\nDmitri Prokofitch brought it to me.

Incongruous as it was with his mood and his cir-\\ncumstances, he felt that strange and bitter sweet sensation \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a1\\uf64b\\nthat every author experiences the first time he sees himself \\nin print; besides, he was only twenty-three. It lasted only a \\nmoment. After reading a few lines he frowned and his heart \\nthrobbed with anguish. He recalled all the inward conflict \\nof the preceding months.',\n",

And Dounia, Dounia was all but \\nbelieving it—what do you say to that? Your father sent twice \\nto magazines—the first time poems (I’ve got the manuscript \\nand will show you) and the second time a whole novel (I \\nbegged him to let me copy it out) and how we prayed that \\nthey should be taken—they weren’t!

The great point is that ev-\\nerything now is going to be different, is going to be broken \\nin two,’ he cried, suddenly returning to his dejection. ‘Ev-\\nerything, everything, and am I prepared for it? Do I want it \\nmyself? They say it is necessary for me to suffer! What’s the \\nobject of these senseless sufferings? shall I know any bet-\\nter what they are for, when I am crushed by hardships and \\nidiocy, and weak as an old man after twenty years’ penal \\nservitude? And what shall I have to live for then? Why am I \\nconsenting to that life now? Oh, I knew I was contemptible \\nwhen I stood looking at the Neva at daybreak to-day!’\\nAt last they both went out. It was hard for Dounia, but \\nshe loved him. She walked away, but after going fifty paces \\nshe turned round to look at him again. He was still in sight. \\nAt the corner he too turned and for the last time their eyes \\nmet; but noticing that she was looking at him, he motioned \\nher away with impatience and even vexation, and turned \\nthe corner abruptly.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf645\\uf64b\\n‘I am wicked, I see that,’ he thought to himself, feeling \\nashamed a moment later of his angry gesture to Dounia. \\n‘But why are they so fond of me if I don’t deserve it? Oh, if \\nonly I were alone and no one loved me and I too had never \\nloved anyone! Nothing of all this would have happened. But I \\nwonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty years grow so meek \\nthat I shall humble myself before people and whimper at ev-\\nery word that I am a criminal? Yes, that’s it, that’s it, that’s \\nwhat they are sending me there for, that’s what they want. \\nLook at them running to and fro about the streets, every \\none of them a scoundrel and a criminal at heart and, worse \\nstill, an idiot. But try to get me off and they’d be wild with \\nrighteous indignation. Oh, how I hate them all!’\\nHe fell to musing by what process it could come to pass, \\nthat he could be humbled before all of them, indiscrimi-\\nnately—humbled by conviction. And yet why not? It must \\nbe so. Would not twenty years of continual bondage crush \\nhim utterly? Water wears out a stone. And why, why should \\nhe live after that? Why should he go now when he knew that \\nit would be so? It was the hundredth time perhaps that he \\nhad asked himself that question since the previous evening, \\nbut still he went.\\n\\uf64a\\uf645\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nChapter VIII\\nW\\nhen he went into Sonia’s room, it was already getting \\ndark. All day Sonia had been waiting for him in ter-\\nrible anxiety. Dounia had been waiting with her. She had \\ncome to her that morning, remembering Svidrigaïlov’s \\nwords that Sonia knew. We will not describe the conver-\\nsation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they \\nbecame. Dounia gained one comfort at least from that in-\\nterview, that her brother would not be alone. He had gone \\nto her, Sonia, first with his confession; he had gone to her \\nfor human fellowship when he needed it; she would go with \\nhim wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask, but \\nshe knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with rever-\\nence and at first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was \\nalmost on the point of tears. She felt herself, on the contrary, \\nhardly worthy to look at Dounia. Dounia’s gracious image \\nwhen she had bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at \\ntheir first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room had remained in \\nher mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.\\nDounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went \\nto her brother’s room to await him there; she kept thinking \\nthat he would come there first. When she had gone, Sonia \\nbegan to be tortured by the dread of his committing suicide, \\nand Dounia too feared it. But they had spent the day trying \\nto persuade each other that that could not be, and both were \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf6460\\nless anxious while they were together. As soon as they part-\\ned, each thought of nothing else. Sonia remembered how \\nSvidrigaïlov had said to her the day before that Raskolnikov \\nhad two alternatives—Siberia or … Besides she knew his \\nvanity, his pride and his lack of faith.\\n‘Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear \\nof death to make him live?’ she thought at last in despair.\\nMeanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in \\ndejection, looking intently out of the window, but from it \\nshe could see nothing but the unwhitewashed blank wall \\nof the next house. At last when she began to feel sure of his \\ndeath—he walked into the room.',\n",
              " 'She gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face \\nshe turned pale.\\n‘Yes,’ said Raskolnikov, smiling. ‘I have come for your \\ncross, Sonia. It was you told me to go to the cross-roads; \\nwhy is it you are frightened now it’s come to that?’\\nSonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange \\nto her; a cold shiver ran over her, but in a moment she \\nguessed that the tone and the words were a mask. He spoke \\nto her looking away, as though to avoid meeting her eyes.\\n‘You see, Sonia, I’ve decided that it will be better so. \\nThere is one fact…. But it’s a long story and there’s no need \\nto discuss it. But do you know what angers me? It annoys \\nme that all those stupid brutish faces will be gaping at me \\ndirectly, pestering me with their stupid questions, which \\nI shall have to answer—they’ll point their fingers at me…. \\nTfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. \\nI’d rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how \\n\\uf64a\\uf6461\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nI shall surprise him, what a sensation I shall make! But I \\nmust be cooler; I’ve become too irritable of late. You know I \\nwas nearly shaking my fist at my sister just now, because she \\nturned to take a last look at me. It’s a brutal state to be in! \\nAh! what am I coming to! Well, where are the crosses?’\\nHe seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could \\nnot stay still or concentrate his attention on anything; his \\nideas seemed to gallop after one another, he talked incoher-\\nently, his hands trembled slightly.\\nWithout a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, \\none of cypress wood and one of copper. She made the sign \\nof the cross over herself and over him, and put the wooden \\ncross on his neck.\\n‘It’s the symbol of my taking up the cross,’ he laughed. \\n‘As though I had not suffered much till now! The wooden \\ncross, that is the peasant one; the copper one, that is Lizave-\\nta’s—you will wear yourself, show me! So she had it on … at \\nthat moment? I remember two things like these too, a silver \\none and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old wom-\\nan’s neck. Those would be appropriate now, really, those are \\nwhat I ought to put on now…. But I am talking nonsense \\nand forgetting what matters; I’m somehow forgetful…. You \\nsee I have come to warn you, Sonia, so that you might know \\n… that’s all— that’s all I came for. But I thought I had more \\nto say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I am going \\nto prison and you’ll have your wish. Well, what are you cry-\\ning for? You too? Don’t. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!’\\nBut his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked \\nat her. ‘Why is she grieving too?’ he thought to himself. \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf646\\uf645\\n‘What am I to her? Why does she weep? Why is she looking \\nafter me, like my mother or Dounia? She’ll be my nurse.’\\n‘Cross yourself, say at least one prayer,’ Sonia begged in a \\ntimid broken voice.\\n‘Oh certainly, as much as you like! And sincerely, Sonia, \\nsincerely….’\\nBut he wanted to say something quite different.\\nHe crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her \\nshawl and put it over her head. It was the green drap de \\ndames shawl of which Marmeladov had spoken, ‘the fam-\\nily shawl.’ Raskolnikov thought of that looking at it, but \\nhe did not ask. He began to feel himself that he was cer-\\ntainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He \\nwas frightened at this.',\n",
              " 'He was suddenly struck too by the \\nthought that Sonia meant to go with him.\\n‘What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, \\nstay! I’ll go alone,’ he cried in cowardly vexation, and al-\\nmost resentful, he moved towards the door. ‘What’s the use \\nof going in procession?’ he muttered going out.\\nSonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He \\nhad not even said good-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A \\npoignant and rebellious doubt surged in his heart.\\n‘Was it right, was it right, all this?’ he thought again as \\nhe went down the stairs. ‘Couldn’t he stop and retract it all \\n… and not go?’\\nBut still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he \\nmustn’t ask himself questions. As he turned into the street \\nhe remembered that he had not said good-bye to Sonia, that \\nhe had left her in the middle of the room in her green shawl, \\n\\uf64a\\uf646\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nnot daring to stir after he had shouted at her, and he stopped \\nshort for a moment. At the same instant, another thought \\ndawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to \\nstrike him then.\\n‘Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I told \\nher—on business; on what business? I had no sort of busi-\\nness! To tell her I was going; but where was the need? Do I \\nlove her? No, no, I drove her away just now like a dog. Did I \\nwant her crosses? Oh, how low I’ve sunk! No, I wanted her \\ntears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart ached! \\nI had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, \\nsome friendly face to see! And I dared to believe in myself, \\nto dream of what I would do! I am a beggarly contemptible \\nwretch, contemptible!’\\nHe walked along the canal bank, and he had not much \\nfurther to go. But on reaching the bridge he stopped and \\nturning out of his way along it went to the Hay Market.\\nHe looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at \\nevery object and could not fix his attention on anything; \\neverything slipped away. ‘In another week, another month \\nI shall be driven in a prison van over this bridge, how shall \\nI look at the canal then? I should like to remember this!’ \\nslipped into his mind. ‘Look at this sign! How shall I read \\nthose letters then? It’s written here ‘Campany,’ that’s a \\nthing to remember, that letter a and to look at it again in \\na month—how shall I look at it then? What shall I be feel-\\ning and thinking then? … How trivial it all must be, what \\nI am fretting about now! Of course it must all be interest-\\ning … in its way … (Ha-ha-ha!

Foo! how people shove! that fat man—a German \\nhe must be—who pushed against me, does he know whom \\nhe pushed? There’s a peasant woman with a baby, begging. \\nIt’s curious that she thinks me happier than she is. I might \\ngive her something, for the incongruity of it. Here’s a five \\ncopeck piece left in my pocket, where did I get it? Here, here \\n… take it, my good woman!’\\n‘God bless you,’ the beggar chanted in a lachrymose \\nvoice.\\nHe went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful, very dis-\\ntasteful to be in a crowd, but he walked just where he saw \\nmost people. He would have given anything in the world to \\nbe alone; but he knew himself that he would not have re-\\nmained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk and \\ndisorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling \\ndown. There was a ring round him. Raskolnikov squeezed \\nhis way through the crowd, stared for some minutes at \\nthe drunken man and suddenly gave a short jerky laugh. \\nA minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him, \\nthough he still stared. He moved away at last, not remem-\\nbering where he was; but when he got into the middle of the \\nsquare an emotion suddenly came over him, overwhelming \\nhim body and mind.\\nHe suddenly recalled Sonia’s words, ‘Go to the cross-\\nroads, bow down to the people, kiss the earth, for you have \\nsinned against it too, and say aloud to the whole world, ‘I \\nam a murderer.’’ He trembled, remembering that. And \\nthe hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especial-\\n\\uf64a\\uf646\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nly of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that \\nhe positively clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, \\ncomplete sensation. It came over him like a fit; it was like a \\nsingle spark kindled in his soul and spreading fire through \\nhim. Everything in him softened at once and the tears start-\\ned into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot….\\nHe knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down \\nto the earth, and kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rap-\\nture. He got up and bowed down a second time.\\n‘He’s boozed,’ a youth near him observed.\\nThere was a roar of laughter.',\n",
              " '‘He’s going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye \\nto his children and his country. He’s bowing down to all \\nthe world and kissing the great city of St. Petersburg and its \\npavement,’ added a workman who was a little drunk.\\n‘Quite a young man, too!’ observed a third.\\n‘And a gentleman,’ someone observed soberly.\\n‘There’s no knowing who’s a gentleman and who isn’t \\nnowadays.’\\nThese exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, \\nand the words, ‘I am a murderer,’ which were perhaps on \\nthe point of dropping from his lips, died away. He bore \\nthese remarks quietly, however, and, without looking \\nround, he turned down a street leading to the police office. \\nHe had a glimpse of something on the way which did not \\nsurprise him; he had felt that it must be so. The second time \\nhe bowed down in the Hay Market he saw, standing fifty \\npaces from him on the left, Sonia. She was hiding from him \\nbehind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf646\\uf649\\nhad followed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at \\nthat moment felt and knew once for all that Sonia was with \\nhim for ever and would follow him to the ends of the earth, \\nwherever fate might take him. It wrung his heart … but he \\nwas just reaching the fatal place.\\nHe went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount \\nto the third storey. ‘I shall be some time going up,’ he \\nthought. He felt as though the fateful moment was still far \\noff, as though he had plenty of time left for consideration.\\nAgain the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about \\non the spiral stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again \\nthe same kitchens and the same fumes and stench coming \\nfrom them. Raskolnikov had not been here since that day. \\nHis legs were numb and gave way under him, but still they \\nmoved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, \\nto collect himself, so as to enter like a man. ‘But why? what \\nfor?’ he wondered, reflecting. ‘If I must drink the cup what \\ndifference does it make? The more revolting the better.’ He \\nimagined for an instant the figure of the ‘explosive lieuten-\\nant,’ Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actually going to him? Couldn’t \\nhe go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch? Couldn’t he \\nturn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch’s lodgings? \\nAt least then it would be done privately…. No, no! To the ‘ex-\\nplosive lieutenant’! If he must drink it, drink it off at once.\\nTurning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door \\nof the office. There were very few people in it this time—\\nonly a house porter and a peasant. The doorkeeper did not \\neven peep out from behind his screen. Raskolnikov walked \\ninto the next room. ‘Perhaps I still need not speak,’ passed \\n\\uf64a\\uf646\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nthrough his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform \\nwas settling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner anoth-\\ner clerk was seating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of \\ncourse, Nikodim Fomitch.\\n‘No one in?’ Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person \\nat the bureau.\\n‘Whom do you want?’\\n‘A-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but \\nI scent the Russian … how does it go on in the fairy tale … \\nI’ve forgotten! ‘At your service!’’ a familiar voice cried sud-\\ndenly.\\nRaskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood \\nbefore him. He had just come in from the third room.',\n",
              " '‘It is \\nthe hand of fate,’ thought Raskolnikov. ‘Why is he here?’\\n‘You’ve come to see us? What about?’ cried Ilya Petro-\\nvitch. He was obviously in an exceedingly good humour \\nand perhaps a trifle exhilarated. ‘If it’s on business you are \\nrather early.[*] It’s only a chance that I am here … however \\nI’ll do what I can. I must admit, I … what is it, what is it? \\nExcuse me….’\\n[*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after \\nsunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the police \\noffice at two in the afternoon he was reproached for coming \\ntoo late.—TRANSLATOR.\\n‘Raskolnikov.’\\n‘Of course, Raskolnikov.

I confess \\nI was sorry I got so hot with you. There it is! But as for my \\nlooking suspiciously at your fainting fit—that affair has \\nbeen cleared up splendidly! Bigotry and fanaticism! I un-\\nderstand your indignation.

Of course, you’ve made friends, I heard. Well, \\nno, Zametov is not here. Yes, we’ve lost Zametov. He’s not \\nbeen here since yesterday … he quarrelled with everyone on \\n\\uf64a\\uf646\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nleaving … in the rudest way. He is a feather-headed young-\\nster, that’s all; one might have expected something from \\nhim, but there, you know what they are, our brilliant young \\nmen. He wanted to go in for some examination, but it’s only \\nto talk and boast about it, it will go no further than that. Of \\ncourse it’s a very different matter with you or Mr. Razumi-\\nhin there, your friend. Your career is an intellectual one and \\nyou won’t be deterred by failure.

On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a \\ntown, one of the administrative centres of Russia; in the \\ntown there is a fortress, in the fortress there is a prison. In \\nthe prison the second-class convict Rodion Raskolnikov \\nhas been confined for nine months. Almost a year and a \\nhalf has passed since his crime.\\nThere had been little difficulty about his trial. The crimi-\\nnal adhered exactly, firmly, and clearly to his statement. He \\ndid not confuse nor misrepresent the facts, nor soften them \\nin his own interest, nor omit the smallest detail. He ex-\\nplained every incident of the murder, the secret of the pledge \\n(the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which was found \\nin the murdered woman’s hand. He described minutely how \\nhe had taken her keys, what they were like, as well as the \\nchest and its contents; he explained the mystery of Lizave-\\nta’s murder; described how Koch and, after him, the student \\nknocked, and repeated all they had said to one another; \\nhow he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Niko-\\nlay and Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty \\nflat and afterwards gone home. He ended by indicating the \\nstone in the yard off the Voznesensky Prospect under which \\nthe purse and the trinkets were found. The whole thing, in \\nfact, was perfectly clear. The lawyers and the judges were \\nvery much struck, among other things, by the fact that he \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf647\\uf649\\nhad hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, with-\\nout making use of them, and that, what was more, he did \\nnot now remember what the trinkets were like, or even how \\nmany there were. The fact that he had never opened the \\npurse and did not even know how much was in it seemed \\nincredible. There turned out to be in the purse three hun-\\ndred and seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being \\nso long under the stone, some of the most valuable notes \\nlying uppermost had suffered from the damp. They were a \\nlong while trying to discover why the accused man should \\ntell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made \\na truthful and straightforward confession. Finally some \\nof the lawyers more versed in psychology admitted that it \\nwas possible he had really not looked into the purse, and so \\ndidn’t know what was in it when he hid it under the stone. \\nBut they immediately drew the deduction that the crime \\ncould only have been committed through temporary men-\\ntal derangement, through homicidal mania, without object \\nor the pursuit of gain. This fell in with the most recent fash-\\nionable theory of temporary insanity, so often applied in \\nour days in criminal cases. Moreover Raskolnikov’s hypo-\\nchondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by \\nDr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and \\nher servant. All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that \\nRaskolnikov was not quite like an ordinary murderer and \\nrobber, but that there was another element in the case.',\n",
              " 'To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this \\nopinion, the criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. \\nTo the decisive question as to what motive impelled him \\n\\uf64a\\uf647\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nto the murder and the robbery, he answered very clearly \\nwith the coarsest frankness that the cause was his miser-\\nable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire \\nto provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three \\nthousand roubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been \\nled to the murder through his shallow and cowardly nature, \\nexasperated moreover by privation and failure. To the ques-\\ntion what led him to confess, he answered that it was his \\nheartfelt repentance. All this was almost coarse….\\nThe sentence however was more merciful than could have \\nbeen expected, perhaps partly because the criminal had not \\ntried to justify himself, but had rather shown a desire to \\nexaggerate his guilt. All the strange and peculiar circum-\\nstances of the crime were taken into consideration. There \\ncould be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken \\ncondition of the criminal at the time. The fact that he had \\nmade no use of what he had stolen was put down partly to \\nthe effect of remorse, partly to his abnormal mental con-\\ndition at the time of the crime. Incidentally the murder of \\nLizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man \\ncommits two murders and forgets that the door is open! Fi-\\nnally, the confession, at the very moment when the case was \\nhopelessly muddled by the false evidence given by Nikolay \\nthrough melancholy and fanaticism, and when, moreover, \\nthere were no proofs against the real criminal, no suspi-\\ncions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word) —all \\nthis did much to soften the sentence. Other circumstances, \\ntoo, in the prisoner’s favour came out quite unexpectedly. \\nRazumihin somehow discovered and proved that while \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf647\\uf64b\\nRaskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor \\nconsumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny \\non supporting him for six months, and when this student \\ndied, leaving a decrepit old father whom he had maintained \\nalmost from his thirteenth year, Raskolnikov had got the \\nold man into a hospital and paid for his funeral when he \\ndied. Raskolnikov’s landlady bore witness, too, that when \\nthey had lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskol-\\nnikov had rescued two little children from a house on fire \\nand was burnt in doing so. This was investigated and fairly \\nwell confirmed by many witnesses. These facts made an im-\\npression in his favour.\\nAnd in the end the criminal was, in consideration of ex-\\ntenuating circumstances, condemned to penal servitude in \\nthe second class for a term of eight years only.\\nAt the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov’s moth-\\ner fell ill. Dounia and Razumihin found it possible to get \\nher out of Petersburg during the trial. Razumihin chose a \\ntown on the railway not far from Petersburg, so as to be \\nable to follow every step of the trial and at the same time \\nto see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulcheria \\nAlexandrovna’s illness was a strange nervous one and was \\naccompanied by a partial derangement of her intellect.\\nWhen Dounia returned from her last interview with her \\nbrother, she had found her mother already ill, in feverish \\ndelirium. That evening Razumihin and she agreed what \\nanswers they must make to her mother’s questions about \\nRaskolnikov and made up a complete story for her mother’s \\nbenefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia \\n\\uf64a\\uf647\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\non a business commission, which would bring him in the \\nend money and reputation.\\nBut they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexan-\\ndrovna never asked them anything on the subject, neither \\nthen nor thereafter. On the contrary, she had her own ver-\\nsion of her son’s sudden departure; she told them with tears \\nhow he had come to say good-bye to her, hinting that she \\nalone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that \\nRodya had many very powerful enemies, so that it was nec-\\nessary for him to be in hiding. As for his future career, she \\nhad no doubt that it would be brilliant when certain sinister \\ninfluences could be removed. She assured Razumihin that \\nher son would be one day a great statesman, that his article \\nand brilliant literary talent proved it. This article she was \\ncontinually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to \\nbed with her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though \\nthe subject was obviously avoided by the others, which \\nmight have been enough to awaken her suspicions.\\nThey began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexan-\\ndrovna’s strange silence on certain subjects. She did not, for \\ninstance, complain of getting no letters from him, though \\nin previous years she had only lived on the hope of letters \\nfrom her beloved Rodya. This was the cause of great uneasi-\\nness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother \\nsuspected that there was something terrible in her son’s fate \\nand was afraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still \\nmore awful. In any case, Dounia saw clearly that her mother \\nwas not in full possession of her faculties.\\nIt happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Al-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf6480\\nexandrovna gave such a turn to the conversation that it was \\nimpossible to answer her without mentioning where Rodya \\nwas, and on receiving unsatisfactory and suspicious an-\\nswers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood \\nlasted for a long time. Dounia saw at last that it was hard \\nto deceive her and came to the conclusion that it was bet-\\nter to be absolutely silent on certain points; but it became \\nmore and more evident that the poor mother suspected \\nsomething terrible. Dounia remembered her brother’s tell-\\ning her that her mother had overheard her talking in her \\nsleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and \\nbefore the fatal day of the confession: had not she made out \\nsomething from that? Sometimes days and even weeks of \\ngloomy silence and tears would be succeeded by a period \\nof hysterical animation, and the invalid would begin to talk \\nalmost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his future…. \\nHer fancies were sometimes very strange. They humoured \\nher, pretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they \\nwere pretending), but she still went on talking.\\nFive months after Raskolnikov’s confession, he was sen-\\ntenced. Razumihin and Sonia saw him in prison as often \\nas it was possible.',\n",
              " 'At last the moment of separation came. \\nDounia swore to her brother that the separation should not \\nbe for ever, Razumihin did the same. Razumihin, in his \\nyouthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations \\nat least of a secure livelihood during the next three or four \\nyears, and saving up a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a \\ncountry rich in every natural resource and in need of work-\\ners, active men and capital. There they would settle in the \\n\\uf64a\\uf6481\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ntown where Rodya was and all together would begin a new \\nlife. They all wept at parting.\\nRaskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before. \\nHe asked a great deal about his mother and was constantly \\nanxious about her. He worried so much about her that it \\nalarmed Dounia. When he heard about his mother’s illness \\nhe became very gloomy. With Sonia he was particularly re-\\nserved all the time. With the help of the money left to her by \\nSvidrigaïlov, Sonia had long ago made her preparations to \\nfollow the party of convicts in which he was despatched to \\nSiberia. Not a word passed between Raskolnikov and her on \\nthe subject, but both knew it would be so. At the final leave-\\ntaking he smiled strangely at his sister’s and Razumihin’s \\nfervent anticipations of their happy future together when \\nhe should come out of prison. He predicted that their moth-\\ner’s illness would soon have a fatal ending. Sonia and he at \\nlast set off.\\nTwo months later Dounia was married to Razumihin. It \\nwas a quiet and sorrowful wedding; Porfiry Petrovitch and \\nZossimov were invited however. During all this period Ra-\\nzumihin wore an air of resolute determination. Dounia put \\nimplicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she \\ncould not but believe in him. He displayed a rare strength \\nof will. Among other things he began attending university \\nlectures again in order to take his degree. They were contin-\\nually making plans for the future; both counted on settling \\nin Siberia within five years at least. Till then they rested \\ntheir hopes on Sonia.\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her bless-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf648\\uf645\\ning to Dounia’s marriage with Razumihin; but after the \\nmarriage she became even more melancholy and anxious. \\nTo give her pleasure Razumihin told her how Raskolnikov \\nhad looked after the poor student and his decrepit father \\nand how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescu-\\ning two little children from a fire. These two pieces of news \\nexcited Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s disordered imagination \\nalmost to ecstasy. She was continually talking about them, \\neven entering into conversation with strangers in the street, \\nthough Dounia always accompanied her. In public convey-\\nances and shops, wherever she could capture a listener, she \\nwould begin the discourse about her son, his article, how he \\nhad helped the student, how he had been burnt at the fire, \\nand so on! Dounia did not know how to restrain her. Apart \\nfrom the danger of her morbid excitement, there was the \\nrisk of someone’s recalling Raskolnikov’s name and speak-\\ning of the recent trial. Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out \\nthe address of the mother of the two children her son had \\nsaved and insisted on going to see her.\\nAt last her restlessness reached an extreme point. She \\nwould sometimes begin to cry suddenly and was often ill \\nand feverishly delirious. One morning she declared that by \\nher reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home, that she re-\\nmembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they \\nmust expect him back in nine months. She began to prepare \\nfor his coming, began to do up her room for him, to clean \\nthe furniture, to wash and put up new hangings and so on. \\nDounia was anxious, but said nothing and helped her to \\narrange the room. After a fatiguing day spent in continual \\n\\uf64a\\uf648\\uf646\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nfancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexan-\\ndrovna was taken ill in the night and by morning she was \\nfeverish and delirious. It was brain fever. She died within a \\nfortnight.',\n",
              " 'In her delirium she dropped words which showed \\nthat she knew a great deal more about her son’s terrible fate \\nthan they had supposed.\\nFor a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his moth-\\ner’s death, though a regular correspondence had been \\nmaintained from the time he reached Siberia. It was carried \\non by means of Sonia, who wrote every month to the Ra-\\nzumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity. \\nAt first they found Sonia’s letters dry and unsatisfactory, but \\nlater on they came to the conclusion that the letters could \\nnot be better, for from these letters they received a complete \\npicture of their unfortunate brother’s life. Sonia’s letters \\nwere full of the most matter-of-fact detail, the simplest and \\nclearest description of all Raskolnikov’s surroundings as a \\nconvict. There was no word of her own hopes, no conjec-\\nture as to the future, no description of her feelings. Instead \\nof any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life, \\nshe gave the simple facts—that is, his own words, an exact \\naccount of his health, what he asked for at their interviews, \\nwhat commission he gave her and so on. All these facts she \\ngave with extraordinary minuteness. The picture of their \\nunhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness and \\nprecision. There could be no mistake, because nothing was \\ngiven but facts.\\nBut Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out \\nof the news, especially at first. Sonia wrote that he was con-\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf648\\uf647\\nstantly sullen and not ready to talk, that he scarcely seemed \\ninterested in the news she gave him from their letters, that \\nhe sometimes asked after his mother and that when, see-\\ning that he had guessed the truth, she told him at last of her \\ndeath, she was surprised to find that he did not seem great-\\nly affected by it, not externally at any rate. She told them \\nthat, although he seemed so wrapped up in himself and, \\nas it were, shut himself off from everyone—he took a very \\ndirect and simple view of his new life; that he understood \\nhis position, expected nothing better for the time, had no \\nill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and \\nscarcely seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, \\nso unlike anything he had known before. She wrote that \\nhis health was satisfactory; he did his work without shirk-\\ning or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent about \\nfood, but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so \\nbad that at last he had been glad to accept some money from \\nher, Sonia, to have his own tea every day. He begged her \\nnot to trouble about anything else, declaring that all this \\nfuss about him only annoyed him. Sonia wrote further that \\nin prison he shared the same room with the rest, that she \\nhad not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that \\nthey were crowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept \\non a plank bed with a rug under him and was unwilling to \\nmake any other arrangement. But that he lived so poorly \\nand roughly, not from any plan or design, but simply from \\ninattention and indifference.\\nSonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no inter-\\nest in her visits, had almost been vexed with her indeed for \\n\\uf64a\\uf648\\uf648\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\ncoming, unwilling to talk and rude to her. But that in the \\nend these visits had become a habit and almost a necessity \\nfor him, so that he was positively distressed when she was \\nill for some days and could not visit him. She used to see \\nhim on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, \\nto which he was brought for a few minutes to see her. On \\nworking days she would go to see him at work either at the \\nworkshops or at the brick kilns, or at the sheds on the banks \\nof the Irtish.\\nAbout herself, Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in \\nmaking some acquaintances in the town, that she did sew-\\ning, and, as there was scarcely a dressmaker in the town, \\nshe was looked upon as an indispensable person in many \\nhouses. But she did not mention that the authorities were, \\nthrough her, interested in Raskolnikov; that his task was \\nlightened and so on.\\nAt last the news came (Dounia had indeed noticed signs \\nof alarm and uneasiness in the preceding letters) that he \\nheld aloof from everyone, that his fellow prisoners did not \\nlike him, that he kept silent for days at a time and was be-\\ncoming very pale. In the last letter Sonia wrote that he had \\nbeen taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of \\nthe hospital.\\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf648\\uf649\\nII\\nH\\ne was ill a long time. But it was not the horrors of pris-\\non life, not the hard labour, the bad food, the shaven \\nhead, or the patched clothes that crushed him. What did he \\ncare for all those trials and hardships! he was even glad of \\nthe hard work. Physically exhausted, he could at least reck-\\non on a few hours of quiet sleep. And what was the food to \\nhim—the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it? In \\nthe past as a student he had often not had even that. His \\nclothes were warm and suited to his manner of life. He did \\nnot even feel the fetters. Was he ashamed of his shaven head \\nand parti-coloured coat? Before whom? Before Sonia? Sonia \\nwas afraid of him, how could he be ashamed before her? And \\nyet he was ashamed even before Sonia, whom he tortured \\nbecause of it with his contemptuous rough manner.

But he judged himself \\nseverely, and his exasperated conscience found no par-\\nticularly terrible fault in his past, except a simple blunder \\nwhich might happen to anyone.

Why should he strive? To live in order to \\nexist? Why, he had been ready a thousand times before to \\ngive up existence for the sake of an idea, for a hope, even for \\na fancy. Mere existence had always been too little for him; \\nhe had always wanted more.

What is meant by \\ncrime? My conscience is at rest. Of course, it was a legal \\ncrime, of course, the letter of the law was broken and blood \\nwas shed. Well, punish me for the letter of the law … and \\nthat’s enough.

Why had he stood looking at the river and pre-\\nferred to confess? Was the desire to live so strong and was \\nit so hard to overcome it? Had not Svidrigaïlov overcome it, \\nalthough he was afraid of death?\\nIn misery he asked himself this question, and could not \\nunderstand that, at the very time he had been standing \\nlooking into the river, he had perhaps been dimly conscious \\nof the fundamental falsity in himself and his convictions. \\nHe didn’t understand that that consciousness might be the \\npromise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his \\nfuture resurrection.\\n\\uf64a\\uf648\\uf64c\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nHe preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct \\nwhich he could not step over, again through weakness and \\nmeanness.

What surprised him most of all was \\nthe terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the \\nrest. They seemed to be a different species, and he looked \\nat them and they at him with distrust and hostility.

There were some Polish exiles, political prisoners, \\namong them. They simply looked down upon all the rest as \\nignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them \\nlike that. He saw that these ignorant men were in many re-\\nspects far wiser than the Poles. There were some Russians \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf6490\\nwho were just as contemptuous, a former officer and two \\nseminarists. Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly.

All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. \\nSome new sorts of microbes were attacking the bodies of \\nmen, but these microbes were endowed with intelligence \\nand will.

Whole villages, whole towns and peoples went mad \\nfrom the infection. All were excited and did not understand \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf649\\uf645\\none another. Each thought that he alone had the truth and \\nwas wretched looking at the others, beat himself on the \\nbreast, wept, and wrung his hands. They did not know how \\nto judge and could not agree what to consider evil and what \\ngood; they did not know whom to blame, whom to justi-\\nfy. Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite. They \\ngathered together in armies against one another, but even \\non the march the armies would begin attacking each oth-\\ner, the ranks would be broken and the soldiers would fall \\non each other, stabbing and cutting, biting and devouring \\neach other. The alarm bell was ringing all day long in the \\ntowns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned \\nand who was summoning them no one knew. The most or-\\ndinary trades were abandoned, because everyone proposed \\nhis own ideas, his own improvements, and they could not \\nagree. The land too was abandoned. Men met in groups, \\nagreed on something, swore to keep together, but at once \\nbegan on something quite different from what they had \\nproposed.',\n",

His heart throbbed painfully as he read it.\\nAgain it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning, \\nat six o’clock, he went off to work on the river bank, where \\nthey used to pound alabaster and where there was a kiln \\nfor baking it in a shed. There were only three of them sent. \\nOne of the convicts went with the guard to the fortress to \\nCrime and Punishment\\n\\uf64a\\uf649\\uf647\\nfetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and \\nlaying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on \\nto the river bank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed \\nand began gazing at the wide deserted river. From the high \\nbank a broad landscape opened before him, the sound of \\nsinging floated faintly audible from the other bank. In the \\nvast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black \\nspecks, the nomads’ tents. There there was freedom, there \\nother men were living, utterly unlike those here; there time \\nitself seemed to stand still, as though the age of Abraham \\nand his flocks had not passed. Raskolnikov sat gazing, his \\nthoughts passed into day-dreams, into contemplation; he \\nthought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited and \\ntroubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she \\nhad come up noiselessly and sat down at his side. It was \\nstill quite early; the morning chill was still keen. She wore \\nher poor old burnous and the green shawl; her face still \\nshowed signs of illness, it was thinner and paler.

She jumped \\nup and looked at him trembling. But at the same moment \\nshe understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into \\nher eyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her be-\\nyond everything and that at last the moment had come….\\nThey wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their \\neyes. They were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces \\nwere bright with the dawn of a new future, of a full res-\\nurrection into a new life. They were renewed by love; the \\nheart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the \\nother.\\nThey resolved to wait and be patient.

But he had risen again and \\nhe knew it and felt it in all his being, while she—she only \\nlived in his life.\\nOn the evening of the same day, when the barracks were \\nlocked, Raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of \\nher. He had even fancied that day that all the convicts who \\nhad been his enemies looked at him differently; he had \\neven entered into talk with them and they answered him \\nin a friendly way.

Everything, even his crime, his sentence \\nand imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of \\nfeeling an external, strange fact with which he had no con-\\ncern. But he could not think for long together of anything \\nthat evening, and he could not have analysed anything con-\\nsciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped into the \\nplace of theory and something quite different would work \\nitself out in his mind.\\nUnder his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up \\nmechanically. The book belonged to Sonia; it was the one \\nfrom which she had read the raising of Lazarus to him. At \\nfirst he was afraid that she would worry him about religion, \\nwould talk about the gospel and pester him with books. But \\nto his great surprise she had not once approached the sub-\\nject and had not even offered him the Testament. He had \\nasked her for it himself not long before his illness and she \\nbrought him the book without a word. Till now he had not \\nopened it.\\nHe did not open it now, but one thought passed through \\nhis mind: ‘Can her convictions not be mine now? Her feel-\\nings, her aspirations at least….’\\nShe too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night \\nshe was taken ill again. But she was so happy—and so un-\\nexpectedly happy—that she was almost frightened of her \\nhappiness. Seven years, only seven years! At the beginning \\nof their happiness at some moments they were both ready \\n\\uf64a\\uf649\\uf64a\\nFree eBooks at Planet eBook.com\\nto look on those seven years as though they were seven days. \\nHe did not know that the new life would not be given him \\nfor nothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it, that it \\nwould cost him great striving, great suffering.\\nBut that is the beginning of a new story—the story of the \\ngradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regen-\\neration, of his passing from one world into another, of his \\ninitiation into a new unknown life.',\n",

              "'Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1849-1864) First published as a short story, it was received with acclamations. In 1849 he was sentenced to death for taking part in conversations against censorship. After eight months in prison he was released and went on to write. He suffered from epilepsy for the rest of his life. Dostoevsky is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia. The young man’s already overwrought inserves a stench from the pot-nerves. The heat and airlessness of the street and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks and dust all about him are so familiar to him. A young man in Petersburg, Russia, is confronted by a drunken man who shouts at him in the street. The young man, who is wearing rags and a hat, is asked to explain why he is wearing them. The man then tells him that he is a \\\\\\'German hatter\\\\\\' and that he should wear a cap. The story is about a young man who returns to the home of a woman he met a month ago. He is asked to pay her back for a watch she pawned for trifles. The story is set in the 1930s and 1940s in the Russian city of Alyona. ‘So she carries  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0the keys in a pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0ring…. And there’s one key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches. That can’t be the key of the  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0chest of drawers … then there must be some other chest or  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0strong-box … that’S worth knowing. How degrading it all is’ There were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides  the two drunken men he had met on the steps, a group of about five men and a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. A man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not ex-tremely so, sat before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with a grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. ‘Poverty is not a vice, that’s a true saying. But beggary is a vice. In poverty you may still re- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0tain your innate nobility of soul, but in beggary—never—no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human society  with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as humiliating as possible’ ‘Well, so be it, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0have the semblance of a beast, but Katerina Ivanovna, my  spouse, is a person of education and an officer’s daughter. And yet, although I realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity—for  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0\\\\xa0‘I repeat without being ashamed, she pullsMy hair, young  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0’ ‘But, my God, if she would but once…. But  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0no, no! It’t all in vain and it\\\\\\'s no use talking! No use talk-centricing! For more Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spir-ited lady, irritable and short—tempered…. But it’s no  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0use going over that! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. Do you suppose that a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen farthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special tal-ent. Marmeladov tells the story of how he was taken back into the service. He describes how his wife made him coffee before he went to work and boiled cream for him. He also describes the time he spent with his wife, Sonia, after she quarrelled with Amalia Fyodorovna. ‘This very quart was bought with her money,’ Marmeladov declared, addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. ‘Thirty copecks she gave me with her own hands, her last, ophobicall she had, as I saw…. She said nothing, she only looked at  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0me without a word…. Not on earth, but up yonder … they  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0grieve over men, they weep, but they don’t blame them’ Raskolnikov met Katerina Ivanovna in Petersburg, Russia. She was the wife of cabinet-maker Kozel, a well-to-do German. The pair went to Kozel\\\\\\'s house to meet his family. They were met by his wife\\\\\\'s mother-in-law, who was terrified. Raskolnikov was dragged into a room by a woman who thought he had drunk all the money in the room. The room was full of men and women, some of them with cards in their hands. Marmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation to him. ‘Get up, why are you asleep?’ she called to him. ‘It’s past ipientnine, I have brought you some tea; will you have a cup? I should think you’re fairly starving?‘Raskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0Nastasya. He asked, slowly and with a sick-inducingly face sitting up on the sofa. It was a long while since he had re-ceive a letter, but another feeling also suddenly stabbed his  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0heart. The letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0Crime and Punishment to open it in her presence. When Nastasya had gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it. Then he gazed intently at the small, sloping handwriting, so dear and familiar, \\\\xa0of the mother who had once taught him to read and write. Dounia and her family were put to shame by Marfa Petrovna, the daughter of the lord of the town. She spread the story of Dounia’s innocence around the town and even to her husband. Mr. Svidrigaïlov repented and gave Marfa a letter proving his daughter\\\\\\'s innocence. The letter was so nobly and touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it. Pyotr Petrovitch is a man of great prudence and prudence. He is a little conceited and likes to be listened to, but this is scarcely a vice. His wife Dounia has the heart of an angel and will make it her duty to make her husband happy. \"I think that perhaps for some reasons, perhaps for my own personal, perhaps old- womanish, fancies, I should do  better to go on living by myself, apart, than with them\" \"I would rather be quite inde-pendent, so long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and  such children as you and Dounia\" \"Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought of see- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0ing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone\" Luzhin’s mother wrote to her son asking if he had met his new wife. He replied that he had, and that she had met him too. The pair had been open with one another all this time, he said. But the tone of the marriage was a foretaste of things to come, he added. ‘Dounia was not that sort when I knew her and … she is still the same, of course! Yes, there’s no denying, the Svid- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0rigaïlovs are a bitter pill!’ ‘She would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett  with a German master than degrade her soul, and her mor- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0al dignity, by binding herself for ever to a man whom she  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0does not respect and with whom she has nothing in com- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0mon’ A young Russian man was walking along a busy street when he saw a woman who seemed to be drunk. He followed her to a seat, but she dropped down in the corner and closed her eyes in exhaustion. A man in rags, who was also walking along the same street, saw the girl and approached her. The man, a plump, thickly-set man, with a high colour, red moustache, shouted at him: ‘Hey! What do you mean?’ Policeman saw the girl staggering down the street and stopped to help her. He took her money and asked her where she lived. She told him she had been given drink and deceived by a man. The policeman was shocked and sympathetic, and offered to take her home. At that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; \\\\xa0in an instant a complete revulsion of feeling came over him. ‘Hey, here!’ he shouted after the policeman, ‘What is it to do with you? Let her go! Let  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0him amuse himself’ Raskolnikov had not seen Razumihin for four months. He decided to go to him to ask for work. He was very poor, and kept his money by work of one sort or another. He spent one whole winter without lighting a stove, and said he liked it better. Raskolnikov had a fearful dream. He dreamt he was back in his childhood in the little town of his birth. The little town stood on a level flat as the hand, not even a willow near it. A few paces beyond the last market garden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a feeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it. Mikolka, a farmer in the Ukraine, was forced to beat a mare to death. The mare had not had a gallop in her for the last ten years. Mikolka’s father tried to stop him, but he tore the whip from his hand and ran to the horse. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill the mare at one blow. He threw down the shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar. ‘Look out,’ he shouted, and with stunning blow he dealt a stunning blow at the poor mare. Raskolnikov met Lizaveta Ivanovna in the Hay Market. She was the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona. The pair were talking to a huckster and his wife. Raskolnickov decided to pawn his watch and make his experiment. Raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more. A strange idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg. He went in like a man condemned to death. He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking. But he felt suddenly in his whole be- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0ing that he had no more freedom of thought, no will. ‘There’s a phenomenon for you,’ cried the student and he  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0laughed. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0half-sister, being the child of a different mother. She worked day and night for her sister, and \\\\xa0besides doing the cooking and the washing, she did sew- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0ing and worked as a charwoman. Raskolnikov was violently agitated after hearing a discussion about killing an old woman in a tavern. He fell into a heavy, leaden sleep and could not be roused from it. His wife Nastasya tried to rouse him but he would not wake up. The author had a dream that he was in an oasis in Egypt and was drinking water from a spring. He had to make a noose for an axe and sew it into his overcoat. The noose was intended for the axe, which he had designed a fortnight before. He was haunted by day-dreams and was unable to sleep when the clock struck six. He decided to steal an axe from the kitchen. The deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago. The more final his resolutions were, the more absurd they at once became in his eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never for a single instant could believe in the carry out of his plans. When he reached the landlady’s kitchen, the door of which was open as usual, he  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0glanced cautiously in to see whether, in Nastasya\\\\\\'s absence,  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0the landlary herself was there, or if not, whether the door  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0to her own room was closed. But what was his amazement  when he suddenly saw that Nast asya was not only at home, but was occupied there, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line. Raskolnikov rang the bell at the door of an old woman\\\\\\'s flat and waited for her to answer. When she did, he heard the latch unfastened and saw two suspicious eyes looking at him. The old woman was at home, but she was suspi-cious and alone. He tried to speak to her, but his voice broke and she said \\\\\\'I have brought him here\\\\\\' Raskolnikov met an old woman at her home in the middle of a busy street. She looked at him mistrustfully and with a sneer in her eyes. He took the pledge and swung an axe at her head. She cried out, but then fell to the floor dead. Raskolnikov found the body of an old woman with a broken skull and a pool of blood. He tried to cut a string from her neck, but it was soaked with blood, so he cut it off with an axe. He also found a purse containing two crosses and an image in sil-phthalver filigree. He ran at once into the bedroom with them and tried to open the chest of drawers. Ras-Raskolnikov heard steps in the room where his murdered sister lay. He jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of the bedroom. Lizaveta stood in the middle of the room gazing in stupefaction at her dead sister. He rushed at her with the axe, but she did not even raise a hand to guard her face. Ivan Raskolnikov saw the door to his flat standing open, with no lock, no bolt, all the time, all  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0that time! The old woman had not shut it after him perhaps  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0as a precaution. He dashed to the door and fastened the latch. He was just taking a step towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps. The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly. Raskolnikov and a young man were trying to get into the home of an old woman. The door was locked and they could not get it to open. The young man tugged at the door-handle and the door began to shake. The old woman had gone for a walk and was not returning. Raskolnikov found the door to the flat locked and the key in the lock. He waited for the killers to come, but they never did. He heard a shout from a flat below and ran down the stairs to meet them. But they had already reached the fourth floor and were looking at bodies. ‘My word, he has been going it!’ someone shouted at him when he came out on the canal bank. ‘If anyone had come in, what would he have thought? I’m drunk but …’ ‘It’s past two o’clock,’ he thought, ‘and at once he leaped up, as if someone had pulled him from the sofa.’ He had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide. He had only thought of money, and so had not prepared a hiding place. He began stuffing all the things  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 into the hole under the paper: ‘They’re in!

He held the shreds he had cut from his trousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. He was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into laughter. ‘If they question me, perhaps I’ll simply tell,’ he thought, as he drew near the police-station. ‘Only to get it over!’ The heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had fallen all those days. The sun shone straight in his eyes, so that it hurt him to look out of them. A young man is summoned to appear before a court in Moscow. He is badly dressed and has no money to his name. The court is full of people, including a lady in mourning. The young man tries to keep his mind on something, but is unable to do so. He feels a sudden rush of relief when he sees the money. ‘Be silent! You are in a government office. Don’t be im- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0pudent, sir!’ cried Raskolnikov. ‘Kindly make the declaration demanded  of you. Show him. Alexandr Grigorievitch. There is a com-ipientplaint against you! You don’n\\\\\\'t pay your debts! You’re a fine bird!\\\\\\' ‘Ilya Petrovitch!’ the head clerk repeated significantly. ‘If there is a scandal in your honourable house once again, I  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0will put you yourself in the lock-up, as it is called in polite society. Do you hear?’ ‘There was a scandal the other day in a restaurant, too. An Crime and Punishment’ Raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something ex- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0ceptionally pleasant to them all. ‘Excuse me, Captain,’ he began easily, suddenly addressing Nikodim Fomitch, ‘will you enter into my position? … I am ready to ask pardon, if I  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0have been ill-mannered. I am a poor student, sick and shat-tered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty. My landlady is a good- hearted woman, but she is so exasperated at my having lost my lessons, and not paying her for the last four months, that \\\\xa0she does Raskolnikov felt as if a nail were being driven  into his skull. The impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat to carry it out. ‘Hadn’t I better think a minute?’ he thought, ‘No, better cast off the burden’ ‘No matter,’ Ilya Petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly. ‘We will notdetain you’ ‘The brutes! they suspect.’‘What if there has been a search already? What if I find them in my room?’ But here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one had peeped in. Even Nastasya had not touched it. How could he have left those things in the hole? \\\\\\'Ilya Ilya\\\\\\' is a novel about the murder of a young girl in London. The novel is about Ilya\\\\\\'s search for the girl who killed his father. Ilya tells how he tried to find a place to throw the body of the girl he killed. But instead he found a hollow in the ground where he had buried the body. Raskolnikov had a terrible longing for some distraction, but did not know what to do. He went up to Razumihin’s room on the fifth floor and opened the door himself. The latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment. I have no lessons, do you see, and I  don’t care about that, but there’s a bookseller, Heruvimov, who takes the place of a lesson. He pays me six  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0for the job. I’ve had six already in advance. We are going to begin a translation about  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0whales, and then some of the dullest scandals out of the sec-��ond part of Les Confessions we have marked for translation. Raskolnikov was on his way home from the university when he saw a magnificent spectacle. He stood still, and gazed long and  profoundly into the distance. He felt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing from his sight. He suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He flung it into the water; then he turned and went home. He lay for half an hour in such anguish, such intolerable terror as he had never before experienced. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate of soup. ‘Nobody has been beating the landlady,’ she declared in a firm, resolute voice. He remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling some on his neck. At last he returned to complete consciousness. He was standing beside him with another person, a complete stranger, who was looking at him very inquisi-tively. But at that moment the door was flung open, and, stooping a little, he was so tall, Razumihin came in. ‘What a cabin it is!’ he cried, ‘I am always knocking my head.’ ‘If you are in an intelli-gible condition, I’ve thirty-five roubles to remit to you,’ said the messenger. ‘How the devil can you do without signing it?’ ‘I don’t want … the money.’ ‘I believe I am not wandering. I believe it’s reality,’ he thought. Raskolnikov said nothing and made no resistance, though he felt quite strong. After sipping a dozen spoonful of tea, he suddenly released the spoon and sank back on the pillow. ‘I was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant influences in the locality, but Pashenka won the day. I had not expected, brother, to find her so … pre-possessing. Eh, what do you think?’ Raskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed  upon him, full of alarm. ‘I know all the ins and outs of your affairs now, my  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0dear boy’ ‘It’s not for nothing that you were so open with  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0Pashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0I say all this as a friend…. But I tell you what it is; an hon- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0est and sensitive man is open; and a business man ‘listens  and goes on eating’ you up’ ‘He calls her Pashenka! Ah, he’s a deep one!’ said Nas- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0tasya as he went out. She was very eager to hear what he would say to the land-lady. ‘Good God, only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not? What if they know it and are only pretending?\\\\\\' ‘I am quite well, I am not ill. Razumihin, have you been  southeastern long?’ ‘I tell you I’ve been waiting for the last three hours,’ said Razmihin. ‘No, before. I fancied then that  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0you were not quite yourself. Now you really look much better. First-rate!’ Raskolnikov bought three shirts, a suit and a pair of boots. The boots were a bit worn, but they’ll last a couple of months, he was told. ‘But perhaps they won’t fit,’ observed Nastasya, ‘Just look!’ and he pulled out a broken boot. ‘He is still depressed,’ Razumihin went on. ‘We’ve just changed his linen and he almost cried.’ ‘He may have anything … soup, tea … mushrooms and  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0cucumbers, of course, you must not give him; he’d better  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0not have meat either, and … but no need to tell you that!\\\\\\' I only say he is a nice man in  his own way! But if one looks at men in all ways—are there  many good ones left? Why, I am sure I shouldn’t be worth a baked onion myself … perhaps with you thrown in. ‘What’s the  most offensive is not their lying, but that they lie and worship their own lying’ ‘This case might be the means of introduc- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0ing a new method. One can show from the psychological data alone how to get on the track of the real man’ ‘Wait! Hear the end. Of course they sought high and low  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0for Nikolay; they detained Dushkin and searched his house;  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0Dmitri, too, was arrested; the Kolomensky men also were  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0turned inside out. And the day before yesterday they ar- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0rested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. He had taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0a dram for it. A few minutes afterwards  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0the woman went to the cowshed, and through a crack in the  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0wall she saw in the stable adjoining he had made a noose of  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0his sash I ran after him, shouting my hardest, and  at the bottom of the stairs I ran right against the porter and some gentlemen. I got hold of Dmitri’s hair and knocked him down and  began beating him. And Dmitri, too, caught me by the hair  and began beating me. But we did it all not for temper but  in a friendly way, for sport. And then Dmitri escaped and  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0ran into the street, and I ran after he; but I did not catch him, and went back to the flat alone. I saw it lying there wrapped up in paper. I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, Bodies upstairs were warm when they found them, says the judge. The real murderer dropped those ear- rings. The only evidence for the defence is that they were beating one another and laughing. ‘That’s the worst of it. Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way upstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much\\\\\\' ‘This is Raskolnikov,’ mumbled Zossimov, nodding to-centricwards him. Then he gave a prolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as possible. He lazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold watch in a hunter’s case, opened it, looked at it and lazily proceeded to put it back. The visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressive-ophobicly: ‘Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin’ Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few days in the capital to rig himself up and rig himself out in expectation of his be- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0trothed. All his clothes were fresh from the tailor’s and were all right, except for a new hat that was too new and too distinctly appropriate. Pyotr Petrovitch was speaking to a group of young men in Petersburg. He said he was \\\\\\'delighted\\\\\\' at the prospect of a younger generation. He also said that Russia had cut itself off from the past, and that was a great thing. Pyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the dis-aviaavowal. He made up his mind to take leave in another  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0minute or two. But before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more phrases. He was evidently anxious to make a few intellectual phrases. ‘I only wanted to find out what sort of man you are’ ‘Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder,’ said Luzhin, ‘and one has but to suppose …’ ‘Is it true that you told your fiancée that what pleased you most …  was that she was a beggar … because it was better to raise  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0a wife from poverty, and reproach her with your being her benefactor?’ asked Raskolnikov. ‘No, that’s not so,‘ put in Zossimov, who had for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man  alone.’ Raskolnikov’s story is told in the form of a novel, Crime and Punishment. The novel is set in the Russian city of Leningrad in the 1930s and 1940s. It is the story of the life of one of the city\\\\\\'s most notorious criminals, a man known as Raskolniki. Raskolnikov wandered through the streets of the Russian capital. He was drawn to the sounds of singing, the tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment. He joined the throng of women, who were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed and wore cotton dresses and goatskin shoes. ‘I’ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks, an hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock, on such a narrow ledge that he’d only room to stand,’ Raskolnikov said. ‘How true it is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature! … And vile  is he who calls him vile for that’ ‘You must have a jolly life, Mr. Zametov; entrance free to the most agreeable places. Who’s been pouring champagne  into you just now?’ ‘We’ve just been … having a drink together…. You talk  about pouring it into me!’ ‘You are either mad, or …’ began Zametov, as though stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind. ‘Why don’t you drink your tea? It’s getting cold,’ said Za-774metov. Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel of bread in his mouth and then seemed to remember everything and pulled himself together. ‘I believe that even a practised, des-perate man cannot always reckon on himself, much less  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0you and I. To take an example near home—that old woman  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0murdered in our district. The murderer seems to have been  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0a desperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight,  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0was saved by a miracle—but his hands shook, too.’ ‘Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead,’ he decided. ‘I’m sick to death of you all and I want to be  alone’ ‘You’ve cross-examined my landlady, I’ll be bound…. Well, that’s enough! Assez causé!  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0Till we meet again!’ Raskolnikov asked Razumihin if he had seen Zametov. He said he had spoken to him and that he was afraid he would be beaten. The two men argued for some time before the man left. Raskolnikov then saw a woman drowning in the canal. He ran after her but she had already disappeared. Dmitry Raskol-phthalnikov saw a woman being pulled from a canal. He felt disgusted and decided to help her. He walked along the canal bank looking for a way out. He eventually came to the house where Nikolay Dmitriyev had lived with his family. ‘I am ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch!’ ‘Why, the old woman and her sister were murdered here?’ Raskolnikov asked. ‘It’s not the time to look at the rooms at night! You ought to come up with a porter at night!\\\\\\' ‘The floors have been washed, they will be painted, they’ll be painted!\\\\\\' Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov went to the police station to report a murder. He told them he had been to the flat where the victim, Shil, was killed. He said he would tell them everything he knew about the murder. The police were suspicious and took him straight to the station. The story of a man who was run over by a carriage in Moscow. The man was taken to the police station but was later released. The story is told from the point-of-view of the man who ran him over. The book is available to download for free from Planet eBook. Crime and Punishment is a novel by Russian author Yevgeny Raskolnikov. The novel is about a man who is taken to hospital after being attacked by a drunkard. The man\\\\\\'s story is told through the eyes of a young boy who is also taken to the hospital by his father. Katerina Ivanovna\\\\\\'s husband was run over by a carriage while crossing the road. She rushed to his side and he tried to reassure her that he would pay for the man\\\\\\'s treatment. But she was in need of atten-ipienttion herself and was unable to stop the tears from flowing. Semyon Zaharovitch was taken to hospital after being kicked by a horse. He was gashed, fractured and had several broken ribs. His friend and neighbour, Amalia Ludwigovna, rushed to his bedside. She begged the doctor to let him die in peace, but he refused. Katerina Ivanovna took little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair and made the children kneel in front of her. The priest, a little, grey old man, ap-peared in the doorway bearing the sacrament. The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his bare knees, bowed down, touching the floor with his forehead. Katerina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man when she saw the priest. She flew at him almost in a frenzy. ‘Ah, father! That’s words and only words! Forgive! If he’d  not been run over, he would have come home to-day drunk and dirty and in rags.’ ‘I’m covered with blood,’ Raskolnikov said with a  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0peculiar air; then he smiled, nodded and went downstairs. He walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious of it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelm- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0ing sensation of life and strength that surged up suddenly  within him. ‘Enough,’ he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly. ‘I’ve done with fancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms!  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0Life is real! haven’t I lived just now? My life has not yet died with that old woman! The Kingdom of Heaven to her! Now for the reign of reason and light … and of will, and of strength … and  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0now we will see! We will try our strength!’ ‘I’ve noticed he is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovna’s. That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it! He took advantage of your fainting at the police station, but he is ashamed of it himself.’ ‘How crushed that boy is now, you wouldn’t believe! ‘I am not worth his little finger,’ he says.‘Oh, not mad. I must have said too much, brother….’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna Raskolnikov’s mother and sister had heard of the death of her brother, Rodya, and were waiting for what would come next. They had heard already  all that had been done for their son during his illness, by this ‘very competent young man,’ as Pulcheria called him. ‘Don’t torture me!’ he said with a gesture of irritation, ‘I will stay with him. Bother all my visitors! Let them rage to their  heart’ content! My uncle is presiding there’ Razumihin was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all the drink he had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect. He stood with the two ladies, persuading them, and giving them reasons with as-tonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every word he squeezed their hands painfully as in a vise. ‘I am drunk like a fool, but I am not drunk from wine. It’s seeing you has turned my head … But don’t mind me! I am talking nonsense!’ ‘I’ll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over my head in the  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0gutter here, and then I shall be all right…. If only you knew how I love you both!\\\\\\' ‘You  may be angry with anyone, but not with me. I am his friend,’ said Razumihin. Pulcheria Alexandrovna was afraid to discuss her affair with Roman Avdotya with her daughter Dounia. She was worried that her daughter would leave her husband. But when she found out that he was unwell, she was determined to keep him. The pair met again at the apartment of the headmistress of the school. Pulcheria Alexandrovna was a woman who retained her beauty to old age. She was the sister of Razumihin, the son of the headmaster of Raskolnikov’s school. She met her brother for the first time at a drinking party. He was so drunk that he blurted out that Praskovya Pavlovna would be jealous of her. ‘Fetching? You said fetching?’ roared Razumihin and he seized him by the throat. ‘Let me go, you drunken devil,’ said Zossimov, strug-gling and when he had let him go, he stared at him and went  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0off into a sudden guffaw. ’Here you have modesty, brother, silence, bashfulness, a  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0savage virtue … and yet she’s sighing and melting like wax, \\\\xa0simply melting! Save me from her, by all that\\\\\\'s unholy!\\\\\\' Razumihin is a Russian writer. He is the author of the novel ‘The Thief’. The book is published by Penguin Books and is available on Kindle and Nook. It is the first of a two-part series on the author’s experiences in Russia. Razumihin met Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Avdotya Romanovna at Bakaleyev’s house. They asked him to bring tea which was served at  last, but in such a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed. He talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interrupted by their questions. ‘You’ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother’s character … and have told it impartially. I am glad. I thought that you were too uncritically devoted to him,’ said Avdotya Romanovna. ‘He loves no one and perhaps he never will.’ ‘I can have no other opinion of your daughter’s future husband,’ Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth,  because Avdotya Romanovna has of her own free will deigned to accept this man. ‘If I spoke so rudely of him  last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and … mad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely …  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0and this morning I am ashamed of it’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia Prokofitch arrived at the home of Dmitri Prok ofitch. Pulcheria was worried about seeing her son, who she feared would be angry with her. But Dmitri was overjoyed to see them, and told them all about his life. Pulcheria Alexandrovna was a patient of Raskolnikov’s. The pair had met before, but Pulcheria had never met him before. He was in a foul-mouthed mood and had not slept since the previous night. Raskol- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0nikov had to restrain himself from shouting. Dounia caught it at  once, and warmly pressed his hand, overjoyed and thank-centricful. It was the first time he had addressed her since their dispute the previous day. ‘Yes, that is what I love him for,’ Razumihin, exaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous  turn in his chair. The mother’s face lighted up with  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0ecstatic happiness. ‘I was literally out of my mind. I gave away all the money you sent me … to his wife for the funeral. She’s a widow now,  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0in consumption, a poor creature … three little children, starving … nothing in the house.’ ‘I had no right to do it I admit, especially as I knew how  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0you needed the money yourself. To help others one must have the right to doing it, or else Crevez, chiens, si vous n’êtes’ ‘I don’t know what to talk about,’ broke Pulcheria Alexandrovna. ‘I was dreaming all the way, in the train, how we should meet, ophobichow we should talk over everything together…. And I was ophobicso happy, I did not notice the journey! But what am I say-handedlying? I am happy now…. You should not, Dounia…. I am\\\\xa0simply in seeing you, Rodya….’ ‘Do you like him, Dounia?’ he asked her. ‘Foo!—what a pig you are!’ Razumihin protested. He got up from his chair and went off to see his fiancé. ’It was a present from Marfa Petrovna,’ answered Pulcheria Alexandrovna.‘What a big one! Hardly like a lady’s’ ‘What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya,’ said Pulcheria Alexandrovna. ‘I am sure it’s quite half through your lodging you have become so melancholy.’ ‘Yes, the lodging had a great deal to do with it…. I thought that, too…. If  only you knew, though, what a strange thing you said just  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0now, mother’ ‘I would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems me and thinks highly of me,’ Dounia Alexandrovna wrote to her brother Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch. ‘What am I making such a fuss for? What is it all  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0about? Marry whom you like!’ Pyotr Petrovitch sent a letter to Dounia asking her to come to an interview with him. He was angry that she had given the money to a widow, not to his daughter. He had seen her for the first time in his life, and was shocked by her modest appearance. Sonia Marmeladov is the daughter of a man who was killed in a car crash. She was brought to the home of Raskolnikov and Dounia Alexandrovna. The two ladies were shocked to see her. They asked her why she had come to see them. Raskolnikov and his wife were invited to a funeral lunch for Katerina Ivanovna, who had given them everything for the funeral. But when they arrived, they were told they would not be able to have dinner with them. They were also told that the funeral lunch would be a plain affair. Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia Petrovitch met Avdotya Romanovna and her daughter Sonia in the city centre. The two women were worried about the health of their father, who was still very ill. They were also worried about Sofya Semyonovna, who they believed was the cause of all the trouble. The story of their meeting is told in a novel called ‘Crime and Punishment’ ‘I will tell you what I want with you,’ said Raskolnikov, drawing Razumihin to the window. ‘You know that … what’s his name … Porfiry Petrovitch?’ ‘I should think so! He is a relation. Why?‘ added the lat-ophobicter, with interest.‘Is not he managing that case … you know, about that  murdering? … You were speaking about it yesterday’ ‘I had heard my father speak of you … only I did not 774know your name, and he did not know it. And now I came, I asked to-day, ‘Where ophobicdoes Mr. Raskolnikov live?’ I didNot know you had only a ophobicroom too…. Good-bye, I will tell Katerina Ivanovna’ ‘I am not going to redeem the things now,’ he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous solicitude about the things. ‘I’ve not more than a silver rouble left … after last night’s ac- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0cursed delirium!’ Raskolnikov was alarmed by what Razumihin had just said about Porfiry. ‘I shall have to pull a long face with him too,’ he thought,  beating heart, and he turned white. But the most natural thing would be to do nothing at all! Raskolnikov and Razumihin burst out laughing as they entered Porfiry Petrovitch’s flat. ‘Not a word here or I’ll … brain you!’ Razumhihin whis- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0pered furiously. The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumi-Globehin received this ‘spontaneous’ mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most genuine fun. Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov met Zametov in his hotel room. He told him he had a \\\\\\'little matter of business\\\\\\' with him. He then asked him to give information to the police about the murder of his friend. He also told him to write to the lawyer in charge of the case to claim back the money. Porfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov. ‘I have been expecting you here for some  perceptions time,’ he said. ’How observant you are!’ ‘But we know all who had pledges, and you are the only  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0one who hasn’t come forward’ ‘The worst of it is they don’t disguise it,’ writes Raskolnikov. ‘They simply spit in my face. They’re as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me! Not a doubt they were talking about me before we came. Do they know about the flat? If only they’d make ophobichaste…. I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use’ ‘The question wasn’t put quite like that,’ observed Porfiry Petrovitch. Razumihin agreed at once, get-ting warm and hurried as usual. ‘Listen, Rodion, and tell us your opinion, I want to hear it. I was fighting tooth and nail  with them and wanted you to help me’ ‘I analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal before and after the crime.’ ‘I only learnt it by chance, the other day. Through the edi-tor; I know him…. I was very much interested\\\\\\' ‘In his article all men are divided into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordi- neurological’ Ordinary men have to live in submission, have no  right to transgress the law, because, don’t you see, they are  commonplace? But extraordinary men have a right to commit any crime, just because they are extraordinary’ ‘Men are in general divided by a law of nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary) and superior (extraordinary)’ ‘The first category is always the man of the present, the second the man. of the future. The first preserve the world and people it; the second move the world to its goal’ ‘People with new ideas, people. with the faintest capacity for saying something new are.extremely few in number, extraordinarily so in fact.’ ‘The appearance of all these grades.and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regu- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0larity some law of nature. That law, of course, is unknown  at present, but I am convinced that it exists, and one day  may become known’ ‘Why the word ought? It’s not a matter of permission. He will suffer if he is sorry for his victim.’ ‘Well, you may abuse me, but I can’t resist,’ he said. ‘I’m sorry, I’ve got to go’ I obtained evidence  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0from some of them, and you are the last…. Yes, by the way,’ Raskolnikov cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, ‘I just remember,  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0what was I thinking of?’ He turned to Razumihin: ‘You were  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0talking my ears off about that Nikolay … of course, I know very well, but what is one to do? We had to trouble Dmi-Tri too…. This is the point, this is all\\\\\\' ‘I will go myself to Porfiry. I will squeeze it out of him, as one of the family: he must let me know the ins and outs of it all! And as for Zametov …’ ‘At last he sees through him!’ thought Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov thought he would squeeze Porfiry like a lemon. He went to the corner where he had put the things and put his hand in the hole under the paper. He felt carefully in every crack and fold of the paper and found nothing. He ran after the stranger and caught him walking along the other side of the street with his eyes fixed on the ground. ‘Murderer!’ he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and dis-phthaltinct voice. ‘You are a murderer,’ the man answered still more articu-lately and emphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred,  and again he looked straight into Raskolnikov’s pale face. ‘The old woman is of no consequence,’ Porfiry Petrovitch thought, hotly and incoherently. ‘A Napoleon creep under an old woman’s bed! Ugh, how loathsome!’ ‘I was in a hurry to overstep…. I didn’t kill a human being, but a principle! I killed the prin-phthalciple, but I didn\\\\\\'t overstep, I stopped on this side…. I was  only capable of killing.’ ‘Does he know I am fol- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0lowing him?’ thought Raskolnikov. ‘So he must have stopped or hid- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0den somewhere’ He reached the third storey, should he go ��on? There was a stillness that was dreadful…. But he went  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0on. The sound of his own footsteps scared and frightened him. ‘I’ve come to you for two reasons. In the first place, I want to make your personal acquaintance, as I have already heard a great deal about you that is interesting and flattering’ ‘I cherish the hope that you may not refuse to help me in a matter directly concerning the welfare of your sister, Avdotya Romanovna’ ‘But this is what the French call bonne guerre and  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0the most innocent form of deception!’ Svidrigaïlov interrupted rudely. ‘You have got rid of Marfa Petrovna, so they say?’ ‘Oh, you’ve heard that, too, then? You’d be sure to,  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0though….’ Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, but you seem to be somehow awfully strange  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0yourself. Say what you like, there’s something wrong with  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0you, and now, too … not this very minute, I mean, but now. ‘I fancy in- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0deed that you are a man of very good breeding, or at least  know how on occasion to behave like one.’ ‘Besides, who  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0wants to be a card-sharper?’ ‘Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me,’ he said, twisting his mouth into a strange smile. ‘She has been three times. I was wide awake every time. She comes, speaks to me for a minute and goes out at the door. I can almost hear her’ The novel is the work of Russian writer Svidrigaïlov. It is the story of a young man who falls in love and loses his wife. The author is haunted by the memory of the woman who gave him his wife\\\\\\'s death. The book is available to download now for free from Planet eBook. ‘I don’t believe in a future life,’ said Raskolnikov. ‘But what do you say to this argument?’ Svidrigaïlov went on, looking at him deliberately. � ‘Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than that?\\\\\\' ‘I want to see Avdotya Romanovna through yourmediation, and if you like in your presence, to explain to her that in the first place she will never gain anything but harm from Mr. Luzhin’ ‘How dare you talk like that!’ cried Raskolnikov not so much angered as astonished. ‘I make the offer with no ulterior motive. You may not believe it, but in the end Av dotya and you  will know.’ ‘I saw you by chance…. I kept fancying there is some-ipientthing about you like me…. But don’t be uneasy. I am not intrusive; I used to get on all right with card-sharpers, and I never bored Prince Svirbey, a great personage who is a distant relation of mine’ ‘Perhaps I’ll  get married instead of the journey. They’re making a match for me’ ‘I don’t  know why I’m afraid of that man. He is very strange, and is determined on doing something…. We must guard Dounia from him’ ‘I thought just now that perhaps I really am mad, and have only seen a phantom’‘What do you mean?’ asked Razumihin. Pyotr Petrovitch and his wife Avdotya Romanovna were invited to meet Luzhin and Razumihin. The three men were seated at a round table with Dounia and Luzhina facing them, and Raskolnikov was beside his sister. The meeting was brief and uneventful. ‘I am convinced that he was the cause of Marfa Petrovna’s death,’ Dounia Alexandrovna told Pyotr Petrovitch. ‘He is the most depraved, and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men, if you care to know’ ‘I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged himself.’ said Avdotya Romanovna. ‘An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep,  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0waked me, and introduced himself,’ Raskolnikov continued. ‘He was fairly cheerful and at ease, and quite hopes that we  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0shall become friends. He is particularly anxious, by the way, for an interview with you, at which he asked me to  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0assist. He has a proposition to make to you, and he told me  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0about it. He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0Petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, and that you can receive the money very shortly ‘My assuming the part of  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you. I don’t want to be mistaken in my  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0choice, and I must not be’ ‘Love for the future partner of your life ought to outweigh your love for your brother,’ he pronounced sententiously, ‘and in any case I cannot be put’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna was a little offended. Luzhin smiled with  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0lofty sarcasm. ‘You may see for yourself, Avdotya Romanovna,’ he said, ‘whether it is possible for us to agree. I hope now that this  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0question is at an end, once and for all.’ ‘Pyotr Petrovitch, do be kind and go!’ he said, quite unable to control himself. ‘Your mamma seems to have entirely for-gotten that I made up my mind to take you, so to speak, after the gossip of the town had spread all over the district’ ‘I see myself that I may have acted very recklessly in disregarding the universal verdict….’ Pulcheria Alexan-drovna was surprised to find that she, too, was glad: she had only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0misfortune. Razumihin was delighted, but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton-weight had fallen off his heart. ‘We will watch him! I will track him out!’ cried Razumi- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0hin, vigorously. ‘I won’t lose sight of him. Rodya has given  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0me leave. He said to me himself just now, ‘Take care of my  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0sister’ Rodya Alexan-Drovna is the author of Crime and Punishment. He was about to set up a publishing firm with his brother Razumihin when he decided to leave. He told his family that it would be better for them to part for a time. ‘I feel ill, I am not at peace…. I will  come of myself or … I’ll  send for you.’ Razumihin’s mother and sister were terribly alarmed. ‘I shall be back directly,’ he shouted to the horror- stricken mother, and he ran out of the house. Ras- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0kolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the pas- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0Crime and Punishment. Razumihin is the author of Crime and Punishment, published by Penguin Books. The novel is set in a small Russian town in the 19th century. Raskolnikov meets the wife of Kapernaumov, a tailor, who is accused of murdering his wife. ‘I should be afraid in your room at night,’ he observed. ‘They all stammer, don’t they?’ ‘Yes…. He stammers and he’s lame. And his wife, too….’ Sonia looked at him almost with dismay. He took her hand. ‘If you only knew! You see, she is quite like a child…. Her mind is quite unhinged, you see … from sorrow. And how clever she used to be … how generous … how kind! Ah, you don’t understand, you don\\\\\\'t understand!’ Sonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands. ‘Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consump-reaction; she will soon die,’ said Raskolnikov. ‘But it will be better if she does die.’ ‘No, not better, not at all better!’ Sonia unconsciously re-peated in dismay. ‘No,’ whispered Sonia. ‘Of course not. Have you tried?’ he added almost ironi- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0cally. � ‘And it didn’t come off! Of course not! No need to ask.’ Another minute passed. He still paced up and down the room in silence, not looking at her. He put his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful face. His eyes were hard, ipientish and piercing, his lips were twitching. He kissed her as from a madman. Sonia was so ashamed of her position that she could not bring herself to jump into the water. Her previous life might, one would have thought, have killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What has kept her from the ca- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0nal till now is the idea of sin and the children. ‘Where is the story of Lazarus?’ he asked suddenly. ‘You are not looking in the right place…. It’s in the fourth  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0gospel,’ she whispered sternly, without looking at him. He sat down with his head on his hand and looked sullenly, prepared to listen. ‘Read! I want you to,’ he persisted. ‘You used to read to  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0Lizaveta.’ She opened the book and found the place. Her hands were shaking, her voice failed her. He un-derstood only too well how painful it was for her to betray him. \\\\\\'I have abandoned my family to-day,’ he said, ‘my moth-centricer and sister. I am not going to see them. I’ve broken with them completely’ ‘What for?’ asked Sonia amazed. Her recent meeting with his mother and sister had left a great impression. She heard his news almost with horror. ‘Let us go together, we are both accursed,\\\\\\' he said. ‘I’m not coming to you to ask forgiveness, but simply to  tell you. I chose you out long ago to hear this, when your fa- progressivelyther talked of you and when Lizaveta was alive, I thought of  it. Good-bye, don’t shake hands. To-morrow!’ Raskolnikov went into the department of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in. He was surprised at being kept waiting so long: it was at least ten minutes before he was summoned. He dreaded meeting that man again; he hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred and was afraid his hatred might betray him. Porfiry Petrovitch was a Russian police officer and head of the department of crime and punishment. Raskolnikov met him for the first time in his office at the police station. The two men exchanged a few words before Porfiry began to ask him questions. ‘I’m often  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0afraid of an attack of paralysis. Do sit down. Please do, or I  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0shall think you are angry …’ Porfiry Petrovitch said. Raskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, still frowning angrily. He did sit down, but still held his  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0cap. Rodion Romanovitch is accused of being a Russian spy. He claims he has proof that he is the man responsible for the murder of Alexander Litvinenko. He says he has a chain of evidence that will prove his innocence. But if he gives in to his suspicions, he says, he will lose his head and die. Rodion Romanovitch: ‘I’m ever so fond of reading all military histories. I’ve certainly missed my proper career. I ought to have been in the army, upon my word I ought. I shouldn’t have been a ipientNapoleon, but I might have was a major, he-he! Well, to proceed, wit in my opinion is a splendid thing, it is, so to say, an adorn-riddenment of nature and a consolation of life, and what tricks it can play!\\\\\\' Porfiry Petrovitch told Raskolnikov about the murder of Razumihin. He also told him about the time he rang a bell at a flat and asked about blood. The two men met again at the end of the day. Porfiry said that he knew about the flat and that he had guessed how Raskolnikov felt. Porfiry Petrovitch asked Raskolnikov why he rang the bell at the murdered woman\\\\\\'s flat. The lawyer replied that he was ill and needed to take care of his mother and sister. Porfiry asked him why he had not arrested him and why he asked the porters to accompany him to the police station. ‘You’ve no evidence, you have only wretched rubbishly sus- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0picions like Zametov’s! You knew my character, you wanted  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests and deputies…. Are you waiting for them? eh! What are  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0you waiting for? Where are they? Produce them?’ Porfiry Petrovitch demanded. ‘I am the murderer…. I want to give evidence,’ Nikolay  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0pronounced. ‘Ach! What did you kill them with?’ ‘An axe. I had it ready.’‘Did you do it alone?‘Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in it’ ‘I should like to wish you success, but your office is such a  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0comical one’ ‘Why comical?’ Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but  seemed to prick up his ears at this. ‘He-he! You are quick-witted. You notice everything!  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0You’ve really a playful mind!’ ‘I have sinned,’ the man articulated softly. ‘By evil thoughts.’ ‘I was vexed that they let you go and took you for drunken. I was so vexed I lost my sleep, and I began making inquiries. And I heard, I heard  how he worried you’ ‘The black snake of wounded vanity’ had been gnawing at Pyotr Petrovitch’s heart all night. He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage. ‘Now we’ll make a fight for it,’ he said, with a malicious smile. Pyotr Petrovitch had heard of Andrey Semyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as a leading young progressive in Petersburg. He had not, of course, been able to form even an approximate ipientnotion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had heard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of some sort, nihilists. Pyotr Petrovitch and Andrey Semyonovitch were talking about the foundation of a new special ‘commune’ Semyo-novitch wanted to talk about his recent breach with Dounia and he was burning with impatience to discourse on that theme. ‘I should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on this feast all the money she got from that  other fool, Raskolnikov. I was surprised just now as I came  through at the preparations there, the wines! Several people ipientare invited. It’s beyond everything!\\\\\\' Ivan Katerina Katerinina is the founder of a new community in the Russian city of Varents. He was inspired by the story of Terebyeva, a woman who left her family for a free marriage. She wrote to her father and mother to tell them she could not be happy with them. He says he was told it was too harsh, that she might have written more kindly. Pyotr Petrovitch and his friend Luzhin Lebeziatnikov had a heated argument over the right of a member of the community to enter another member’s room. ‘You are always thinking of something unpleasant,’ he said, ‘Tfoo! How vexed I am that when I was \\\\xa0expounding our system, I referred prematurely to the ques- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0tion of personal privacy!’ ‘And what do you find so shameful even in cesspools? I’m the first to be ready to clean out any cesspool you’d like. And it’’ Pyotr Petrovitch asked Sonia to make an excuse for why she was not at the dinner with him and his family. He also asked her to apologise to Katerina Ivanovna, the woman who stood in the place of a mother to him. He then asked Lebeziatnikov to leave him alone with the woman. Pyotr Petrovitch spoke to the widow of an official who had died in the service. The widow, Katerina Ivanovna, was desperate for help. Pyotr told her that he had promised her a pension. He warned her that God would repay her for her efforts. ‘Because I don’t want in your free marriage to be made a.fool of and to bring up another man’s children,’ Luzhin replied. ‘Children are a social question and a question of first importance, I agree. But the question of children has another solution. Some re-fuse to have children altogether, because they suggest the.institution of the family.’ Katerina Ivanovna was sick of her husband before he died. She was annoyed that none of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral. She felt that Amalia had done her work well and was treated with extraordinary respect. She decided to put Amalia down and set her in her ‘proper place’ ‘It’s all that cuckoo\\\\\\'s fault! You know whom I mean?  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0Her, her!’ Katerina Ivanovna nodded towards the landlady. ‘Have you tasted the pancakes? Take some  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0more! Have some beer! Won’t you have some vodka?’ ‘If your spoons should happen to be stolen, I won\\\\\\'t be responsible! Ha-ha-ha!\\\\\\' ‘My late husband certainly had that weakness, and every- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0one knows it,’ Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once. ‘He was a kind and honourable man, who loved and respect- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0ed his family. The worst of it was his good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people, and he drank with fel- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0lows who were not worth the sole of his shoe. Would you believe it, Rodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0cock in his pocket; he was dead drunk, but he did not forget  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0the children!’ Katerina Ivanovna spoke of Sonia who would go with her to T — and help her in all her plans. Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0Ivanovna suddenly burst into tears. At this someone at the further  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0end of the table gave a sudden guffaw. Amalia IvanovNA, deeply aggrieved at  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 taking no part in the conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort. Pyotr Petrovitch met with his wife, Amalia Ivanovna, to discuss her relative\\\\\\'s plight. He told her that a note had gone missing from the table where they had been talking. He said that if she did not tell him where it was, he would have to take\\\\\\'very serious measures\\\\\\' Sonia Lebeziatnikov was accused of stealing money from a man. The incident took place in front of a crowd of people in a Russian hotel. The man\\\\\\'s wife, Katerina Ivanovna, was the first to confront Sonia. Her husband, Raskol-Petr Petrovitch, was also in the room. Sonia Luzhin was accused of stealing a hundred-rouble note from her husband. Pyotr Petrovitch and Katerina Ivanovna took her to the police and had her searched. The note contained a description of a parabola that had taken place in the air. Raskolnikov gazed intently at him, as though seizing and weighing each word. ‘I saw it, I was a witness, I’ll take my oath! He did it, he!’ repeated Lebeziatnikov, addressing all of them. Pyotr Petrovitch was accused of embezzling money from his sister\\\\\\'s bank account to pay for the funeral of a friend of his fiancee. He was accused by her brother-in-law Luzhin Raskolnikov of being a\\\\\\'spiteful\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'contemptible\\\\\\' man. The trial was adjourned until next week. Pyotr Petrovitch had been accused of stealing from the commissariat. He was accused of obstructing the course of justice and of being a thief. The judge threw a glass at him, hitting Amalia Ivanovna in the face. Pyotr was not intimidated and left the house an hour later. ‘What! As though that godless calumny was not enough— \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0this vile creature attacks me! What! On the day of my husband’s funeral I am turned out of my lodging! After eat-ing my bread and salt she turns me into the street, with my  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0Crime and Punishment! Where am I to go?’ wailed the poor woman. ‘Good God!’ she cried with flashing eyes, ‘is there no justice upon earth? Whom should you protect if not us orphans? We shall see! There is law and justice on earth, there is, I will find it! Wait a bit, ‘If she doesn’t find you here, you’ll be blamed for it….’ ‘I told you yesterday that I was not coming to ask for forgiveness and almost the first thing I’ve said to you is to ask you for forgiveness, Sonia…. I was asking for forgiveness for my own sake.’ Sonia asked him to tell her who killed Lizaveta, but he could not say a word. She sat down on the bed beside him and waited, not taking her eyes off him. He turned his deadly pale face to her and said: ‘Why have I come to torture you?’ ‘It’s all nonsense…. Listen, Sonia.’ Sonia asked him how he knew about Lizaveta\\\\\\'s death. He looked at her with the same helplessness and the same terror. She looked at him for a while and, suddenly, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast. She then began to get up from the bed and kept her eyes fixed even more immovably on him. ‘I’ll follow you to Siberia!’ cried Sonia. ‘Then you won’t leave me, Sonia?’ he said, looking at her  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0almost with hope. She looked at him bewildered. She knew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. And the terrible idea of the murder over-whelmed her. In his changed tone she seemed to hear the  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0murderer speaking. ‘If I’d simply killed because I was hungry,’ he said suddenly with conviction, ‘I should be happy now. You must believe that! What would it matter to you if I were to confess that I did wrong?’ ‘We are so different…. And you know, So- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0nia, it’s only now, only this moment that I understand where I am.’ ‘You are right again, Sonia. Of course that’s all nonsense,’ he said. ‘I’ve been talking nonsense a long time…. There were quite, quite other causes for it! I haven’t talked to anyone for so long, Sonia…. My head aches dreadfully now’ I preferred lying still and think- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0ing. And I had dreams all the time,  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0strange dreams of all sorts, no need to describe! Only then  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0I began to fancy that … No, that’s not it! Again I am tell-phthaling you wrong! ‘What suffering!’ A wail of anguish broke from Sonia. ‘Go at once, this very minute, stand  at the cross-roads, bow down, first kiss the earth which you  have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say to  all men aloud, ‘I am a murderer!”’ Sofya Semyonovna and Raskolnikov met in prison. They were both mourning and dejected. They sat side by side, as though they had been cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore. The door was opened by the flaxen head of the police. ‘She has certainly gone mad!’ he said to Raskolnikov, as they went out into the street. ‘I didn’t want to frighten So- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0fya Semyonovna, so I said ‘it seemed like it,’ but there isn’s  a doubt of it. They say that in consumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain’ ‘Do you know that in Paris they have been conducting serious ex- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0periments as to the possibility of curing the insane?’ Raskolnikov met Dounia for the first time in a week. She told him that Dmitri Prokofitch had told her that there was no danger. She also said that if he ever needed her, he should call her and she would come. He was not cold to her. Katerina Ivanovna was arrested after she took a group of gutter children from her home in Dounia. The children were taken to a nearby canal and she was seen rapping on a frying-pan and making the children dance. Raskolnikov went to find his wife, Sonia, but she had already been taken to the police. Katerina Ivanovna was furious at the sight of her two children begging in the streets. The children were dressed as street singers, but Katerina refused to let them go. She made up a fantastic story about a wretch of a general who would protect the family. Katerina Ivanovna was in distress when she was stopped by a policeman. She told him that she had buried her husband the day before. The policeman gave her a green three-rouble note to calm her down. She then began to sing to him in French to calm him down. Sonia and Polenka rushed after them. ‘Where are the children?’ she said in a faint voice, ‘You’ve brought them back, Sonia! Oh stupid,  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0ungrateful children!’ ‘Polenka! catch them…. It’s for your sakes I …’ She stumbled as she ran and fell down. ‘I’ve had enough! The ball is over. Lay me down, let me die in peace.’ ‘Your excellency!’ she wailed suddenly with a heart-rending scream and a flood of tears. ‘protect the orphans! You have been their father’s guest … one may say aristocratic….’ ‘I will put those two little ones and  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0Polenka into some good orphan asylum, and I will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming of  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0them. And I will pull her out of the mud too, for she is a  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0good girl, isn’t she? So tell Avdotya Romanovna that that is  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0how I am spending her ten thousand’ Sonia too was very busy. At their last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he had made an arrangement,  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna’s chil- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0dren. He said something too  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0to see Raskol- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0nikov. Raskolnikov was in a state of panic when he was confronted by Razumihin. He had not seen his mother or sister in three days. He was worried that they had been taken from him by Dounia. But when he went to see them he found them dead and his sister in mourning. Razumihin is the author of the novel Crime and Punishment, published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99. The novel is set in the Russian city of Dnepropetrovsk in the early 1900s. The author is the son of a former tsar and the grandson of a tsar. ‘She got a letter to-day. It upset her very much,’ Raskolnikov said. ‘Yes, and you didn’t know? hm …’ ‘Good-bye, Rodion. There was a time, brother, when I…. ipientNever mind, good-bye.’ Raskolnikov was\\\\\\'stunned\\\\\\' when he saw Porfiry at the door of his flat. He had been\\\\\\'suffocating\\\\\\' since the scene with Nikolay at his home. He thought of Svidrigaïlov as a \\\\\\'riddle\\\\\\' and that he might be able to escape. ‘I’ve come to have it out with you, Rodion Romanovitch,’ Porfiry Petrovitch said. ‘I have perhaps acted unfairly to you; I feel it. Do you remember how we parted? Your nerves were unhinged and your knees were shaking and so were mine. And, you know, our behaviour was unseemly, even ungentlemanly’ ‘I’ve  caused you a great deal of suffering, Rodion Romanovitch. I am not a monster.’ ‘I regard you in any case as a man of noble character and  not without elements of magnanimity, though I don’t agree with all your convictions. When I made your acquaintance, I felt attracted by you’ ‘I was here when you were lying ill in bed, not officially, not in  my own person, but I was here. Your room was searched to the last thread at the first suspicion; but umsonst! I thought to myself, now that man will come, will come of himself  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0and quickly, too; if he’s guilty, he\\\\\\'s sure to come.’ ‘Think of blurting out in a restaurant ‘I killed her’ It was too ophobicdaring, too reckless. I thought so myself, if he is guilty he ophobicwill be a formidable opponent’ Razumihin is not the right man for the job. He is innocent and responsive to influence. He has a heart,  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0and is a fantastic fellow. He sings and dances, they say, so that people come from other villages to  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0hear him. He attends school too, and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger to him. ‘Here we have bookish dreams, a heart unhinged by theories. Here we see resolution in the first stage, but resolution of a special kind: he resolved to  do it like jumping over a precipice or from a bell tower’ ‘He committed the murder and couldn’t take the money, and what he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone’ ‘I don’t want you to look upon me as a monster,’ Porfiry Petrovitch told Rodion Romanovitch. ‘I’ve come to you with a direct and open proposition—that you should surrender and con- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0fess. It will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my advantage too, for my task will be done.’ ‘Suffering, too, is a good thing. Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer. I know that you don’t believe in it, but indeed, life will bring you through. You will live it down in time. What you  need now is fresh air, freshAir, fresh air!’ Raskolnikov positively started. ‘But who are you? what prophet are you?\\\\\\' Porfiry Petrovitch was told by Raskolnikov that he had confessed nothing to him. The two men went out for a walk in the evening. Porfiry was worried that his friend Svidrigaïlov had not been to see him. He was also worried about his future. Raskolnikov went to see Svidrigaïlov to find out if he had designs on Dounia. He was terrified when he saw him sitting at a tea-table with a pipe in his mouth. The man was watching him silently, his heart was beating violently out of his eye. Raskolnikov went up into the tavern. He found Svidrigaïlov in a tiny back room, adjoining the saloon. In the room he found also a boy with a little hand organ. A red- cheeked girl of eighteen was wearing a Tyrolese hat with ribbons. I told you of this tavern myself, there is no miracle in your coming straight here. I\\\\\\'m convinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves as they walk. If only we had scientific men, doctors, lawyers andphilosophers might make most valuable investigations in Petersburg each in his own line. ‘Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?’ said Raskolnikov suddenly. ‘Even though perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me, I don’t want to put  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0myself out any more. I’ve come to tell you at once that if you keep to your former intentions with  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0regard to my sister and if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has been discovered of late, I will kill you before you get me locked up.’ ‘What of it? You seem to find something wrong in my speak- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0ing like that about women?’ ‘You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?\\\\\\' ‘Vice! Oh, that’s what you are after! But I’ll answer you  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0in order, first about women in general; you know I am fond  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0of talking. Tell me, what should I restrain myself for? Why should I give up women, since I have a passion for them? ‘I was in the debtors’ prison here, for an immense sum, and had not any expectation of being able  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0to pay it. Marfa Petrovna bought me out; do you know to what a point of  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0insanity a woman can sometimes love? She was an honest  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0woman, and very sensible, although completely uneducat- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0ed. But a sensible woman and a jealous woman are two different things, and that’s where the trouble came in\\\\\\' Rodion Romanovitch was a Russian aristocrat in the second or third century A.D. His sister, Avdotya Romanovna, was the daughter of a reigning prince or pro-consul in Asia Minor. The pair fell in love and married, but the marriage ended in divorce. Rodion tells the story of his sister\\\\\\'s suicide. All my tactics lay in simply  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0being utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I main- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0tained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0my treachery. In fact, I triumphed, while my lady remained \\\\xa0convinced\\\\xa0that she was innocent, chaste, and faithful. I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all. ‘Why, you are dropping them even now,’ said Svidrigaïlov. ‘Why are you so afraid of now?’ ‘Me—afraid? Afraid of you? You have rather to be afraid of me, cher ami. But what nonsense…. I’ve drunk too much  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0though, I was almost saying too much again.’ ‘I’ve talked to her twice, she is far from a fool. Sometimes she steals a look at  me that positively scorches me’ ‘The day after we’d been betrothed, I bought her presents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles — a set of diamonds and pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this’ I found out that they had nothing of their own and had come to town upon some legal business. I offered to assist in the young girl’s education in  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0French and dancing. My offer was accepted with enthusi- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0asm as an honour—and we are still friendly…. If you like, we’ll go and see them, only not just now. ‘I’m coming to your lodgings, not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna,’ said Raskolnikov. ‘That’s as you like, but she is not at home.’ ‘No matter, I’ll come all the same,‘ said Svidrigaïlov. � ‘I am convinced that  you regard me with suspicion just because I have shown  such delicacy and have not so far troubled you with ques-uctivetions … you understand? It struck you as extraordinary; I  don’t mind betting it\\\\\\'s that. Well, it ‘There was something about Svidrigaïlov which gave him a certain original, even a mysterious character’ ‘To think that I could for one instant have looked for help from that coarse brute, that depraved sensualist and black-guard!’ he cried. Dounia met her brother Svidrigaïlov on the street. He told her he had been sitting with him in a restaurant. He had heard of her letter to her brother Raskolnikov and suspected something. Dounia was frightened by his excitement. He asked her to come with him. Svidrigaïlov’s flat was exactly between two sets of almost uninhabited apartments. His rooms were not entered directly from the estinalpassage, but through the landlady\\\\\\'s two almost empty rooms. Dounia stopped in the doorway, not knowing what she was called to look upon. ‘Can’t sit down  here’ he asked her. Svidrigaïlov met Dounia Romanovitch in her room. He told her about his brother, Rodion, and how he was a thief. She was shocked and said she didn\\\\\\'t believe him. He said he had killed an old woman and her sister to steal from them. ‘I want to see Sofya Semyonovna,’ Dounia articulated faintly. ‘How do I go to her? She has come in, perhaps. I must see her at once. Perhaps she …’ ‘Ah, I see you were lying, I don’t believe you!’ she cried. Svidrigaïlov asked Dounia to take him abroad. He said: \\\\\\'I have money, I can get a ticket in three days. Would you like me to take him abroad? I have money and friends. I’ll send him away at once. I have friends … capable people…. If you like, I\\\\\\'ll take a passport for you … for your mother.\\\\\\' Svidrigaïlov was almost beginning to rave…. Something seemed suddenly to go to his head. Dounia jumped up and rushed  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0to the door. ‘Open it! Open it!’ she called, shaking the door, ‘Is there no one there?’ His still trem-bling lips slowly broke into an angry mocking smile. ‘Aha! So that’s it, is it?’ he cried, surprised but smil- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0ing maliciously. ‘Well, that completely alters the aspect of  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0�\\\\u2009�\\\\u200c�’�Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com. ‘Let me be,’ she cried in despair. ‘I swear I’ll shoot again.’ ‘Well … at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you don’t … then.” ‘And … now, of course she would kill him, at two paces!’ Suddenly she flung away the revolver. Svidrigaïlov was taken to a drinking-bar where tea was served. A fight seemed imminent and he was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to them for a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that he could not understand them. He paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of the garden. Svidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him. She timidly prepared to listen. ‘I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna,’ he said, ‘and as I am probably seeing you for the last  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 time, I have come to make some arrangements.’ Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov was engaged to be married to Sofya Semyonovna. He visited his betrothed\\\\\\'s parents in the middle of the night in the pouring rain to give her 15,000 roubles as a present. He left his wife Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague apprehension. Svidrigaïlov went to a hotel in a God-forsaken place. He asked a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The man led him to a tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under the stairs. A strange persistent murmur  sometimes rose to a shout in the next room attracted his attention. He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another. ‘It must be a garden  under the window,’ he thought, ‘There’s a sound of trees.’ He remembered how  he had disliked it when he passed Petrovsky Park just now. He felt a longing to fix his imagination on something. Svidrigaïlov was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket as before. The wind was howling under the window. ‘How disgusting,’ he thought with annoyance. He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the window and thought: ‘It’s better not to sleep at all’ He kept dwelling on images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden. ‘It’s the best minute; I couldn’t choose a better.’ Svidrigaïlov walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding anyone and was just going to call out when he saw a strange object. He bent down with the candle and saw a little girl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. He had overslept himself! He got up, put on his still damp jacket  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0and overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his pocket, he took it  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0out and then he sat down. He took a notebook out of his pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote  a few lines in large letters. Raskolnikov put the revolver to his right temple. Achilles cried: ‘You can’t do it here, it’s not the place,’ cried Achilles. ‘Well, brother, I don\\\\\\'t mind that. It\\\\\\'s a good place. When  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0you are asked, you just say he was going, he said, to Amer- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0ica’ He flung the article on the table with disgust and anger. ‘But, however foolish I may be, Rodya, I can see for my- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0self that you will very soon be one of the leading—if not the leading man—in the world of Russian thought.’ ‘I keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights. Your sister  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0lay talking in her sleep all last night, talking of nothing but  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0you. I felt all the morning as though I were going to be hanged, waiting  for something, expecting something, and now it has come!’ ‘I can’t stay, I must go now….’ Raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair. Dounia stood at the other end of the table and looked at him with anguish. ‘I’ve been all day with Sofya Semyonovna. We were both waiting for you,’ he said. \\\\\\'I am going at once to give myself up. But I don’t know why I am going to giving myself up\\\\\\' \\\\\\'I am further than ever from seeing that what I did was a crime. I’ve never, never been stronger  and more convinced than now\\\\\\' ‘I used to talk a great deal about it to her, only to her’ ‘To her heart I confided much of what  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0has since been so hideously realised. Don’t be uneasy,’ he returned to Dounia, ‘she was as much opposed to it as you,  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0and I am glad that she is gone. The great point is that ev-774erything now is going to be different, is going-to be broken  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0in two’ Raskolnikov took out two crosses, one of cypress wood and one of copper. Sonia made the sign of the cross over herself and over him, and put the wooden one on his neck. He laughed. ‘It’s the symbol of my taking up the cross,’ he laughed. He could not stay still or concentrate his attention on anything. ‘What’s the use of going in procession?’ he muttered going out. ‘Couldn’t he stop and retract it all… and not go?” ‘How low I’ve sunk! No, I wanted her terror, to see how her heart ached!’ ‘I dared to believe in myself,  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0to dream of what I would do! I am a beggarly contemptible  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0wretch, contemptible!\\\\\\' ‘Quite a young man, too!’ observed a workman who was a little drunk. ‘And a gentleman,’ someone observed soberly, ‘There’s no knowing who\\\\\\'s a gentleman and who isn’t nowadays’ ‘I am a murderer,” which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips, died away. He bore these remarks quietly, however, and, without looking around, he turned down a street leading to the police office. ‘It is  \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0the hand of fate,’ thought Raskolnikov. ‘Why is he here?’ ‘You’ve come to see us? What about?‘ cried Ilya Petro-vitch. Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after two in the afternoon. Ilya Petrovitch is a Russian journalist and author. He is best known for his novel, The Death of Ivan the Terrible. In the book he tells the story of a man who shot himself in the back of the head. The man, Svidrigaïlov, had lost his wife and was drinking wine. Rodion Raskolnikov was found guilty of the murder of a woman and her sister. He was sentenced to life in prison and has been there for nine months. The book is published by Simon & Schuster and is available on Kindle and Nook, with a free download of the book. The sentence however was more merciful than could have  been expected, perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself, but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt. There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken  condition of the criminal at the time. The fact that he had made no use of what he had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse. Dounia was married to Razumihin and the pair planned to emigrate to Siberia. But Raskolnikov was sent to prison and they were separated for nine months. Dounia became increasingly anxious about her son\\\\\\'s health. She would sometimes cry suddenly and was often ill. Pulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her bless- \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0 \\\\xa0Crime and Punishment. Raskolnikov did not know of his moth-er’s death, though a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached Siberia. His mother Sonia wrote every month to the Ra-774zumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity. She gave the most matter-of-fact detail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov\\\\\\'s surroundings as a convict. Svidrigaïlov was sentenced to life in prison for killing himself. He was released after eight years and was able to start a new life. He asked himself: why had he not killed himself? And why was the desire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it? Sofya Semyonovna was a Russian woman who lived in the town of Raskolnikov. She was well-liked by all the prisoners in the area. She would write and post letters for them to their relations. They even came to her for help in their illnesses. But she had a dark secret. She had a secret past. Sofya Semyonovna was a prisoner in a Russian prison. She sent Raskolnikov a note saying she was ill and would soon come and see him. When he was well again he saw her at the hospi-tal gate but she did not come. He wept and threw his arms round her knees. For the first instant  she was terribly frightened and she turned pale. But at the same moment  she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her eyes. They wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes. He knew with what infinite love he would repay all her sufferings. That might be the sub-ject of a new story, but our present story is ended. That might be a sub-jected of anew story. But our current story is over. That\\\\\\'s the end of the story. The end of our story. We\\\\\\'re done.'"
